the number one thing to remember when interacting with someone affected by any form of interpersonal violence is to never blame them .
victim blaming perpetuate the isolation that they are already feeling and will not help the situation in any way , shape or form .
remember that their safety , not just physically but mentally and emotionally as well , are most important .
