consider rotating the eggshell on how dry it is in your home , you may need to water the seeds every day to every few days .
this will allow the plants to get equal amounts of sunlight and grow more evenly.you may need to pull out the smaller/weaker seedlings so that each eggshell has one plant growing in it .
