the longer you let red wine sit in your carpet , the harder it will be to get rid of the stain .
do yourself a big favor by acting fast ! as soon as you notice the spill , grab a paper towel or rag and blot the stain to pick up as possible before it can set .
always use an up-and-down motion , not a side-to-side rubbing one .
