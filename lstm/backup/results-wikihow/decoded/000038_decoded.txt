if this is required for the program that you will be applying for , make the most of this experience ! try to form a good relationship with the physical therapists you shadow , as you will probably need them to write recommendation letters for you.in addition to helping you get into a doctoral program .
if this is more beneficial , so seek out as many relevant opportunities as possible .
