if you 're seriously trying to avoid alcohol , make plans with other people who are in the same boat .
that way you wo n't be faced with the presence of alcohol every time you want to have a little fun .
if you 're drinking does n't mean you have to.maybe they will pick up on your attempts to cut back and do the same .
