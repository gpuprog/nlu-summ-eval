if you 're requesting a certified copy , you usually must be related to the person as defined by state law .
in most states , certified copies are available for parents , children , and siblings of the deceased.some jurisdictions require death records request forms to be signed in front of a notary .
staff at the vital records office will tell you if this is required , but do n't sign it until you are in the presence of a notary .
