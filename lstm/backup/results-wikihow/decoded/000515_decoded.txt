when you 're speaking to someone with a disability , do n't use patronizing gestures such as patting her on the back or head .
it may be acceptable to talk to people who have hearing loss in a louder than average voice , so that they are able to hear you .
usually , someone will mention it to you if you are speaking too quietly .
if in doubt , speak casually and ask about their language needs .
