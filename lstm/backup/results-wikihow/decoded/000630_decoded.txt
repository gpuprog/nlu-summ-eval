interval training mimics the stopping and starting that your body will go through during a boxing match .
run for 200 , 400 , 600 , or 800 meters as fast as you can , and then rest for 1 minute between each interval.do interval running 2 or 3 days a week and never on consecutive days .
for example , do intervals on monday , and friday instead of tuesday , and thursday .
adjust the amount of intervals you are doing based on the length of your fight .
