since they are n't genuinely looking forward to seeing you , they turn you into a backup plan and ask you out only when they do n't have anything `` better '' lined up for an evening .
if you always get a `` maybe '' from the guy when you ask him out , it could mean that he does n't want to commit in case another , more preferable offer comes up .
