a higher rate of depreciation is recorded in the beginning , and the rate of depreciation declines over time .
this method would be used for equipment that is used more in the early years of its life than in later years as it becomes less productive .
therefore it is more accurate to record more of the expense through depreciation earlier and less later on as the equipment 's productivity declines .
