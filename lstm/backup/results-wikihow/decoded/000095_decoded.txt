your vet will perform either abdominal surgery or an endoscopy.because abdominal surgery is expensive , and can have serious complications , your vet will likely recommend an endoscopy .
to perform an endoscopy , your vet will anesthetize your dog and insert a thin endoscopy tube either down your dog 's throat or up through the large intestine .
the tube has a camera at the end of the problem .
