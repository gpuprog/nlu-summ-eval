if it ca n't be honored -lrb- such as cases in which health/safety is at stake -rrb- , a child needs to know that they are allowed to say no and `` i ca n't '' ? if something is uncomfortable or painful , do adults let them not do it ? if they need to do something they do n't like , are any explanations given ? does the adult try to make adjustments to make it more comfortable ?
