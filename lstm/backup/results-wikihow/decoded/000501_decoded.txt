when a point guard sees a teammate with an opportunity to score , he wants to get the ball into his teammate 's hands as possible so that the teammate can score before his opportunity passes .
at the highest levels of basketball , point guards sometimes use no-look passes , behind the back passes , and complicated fake-out moves to great effect .
however , unless you 're experienced with these sorts of moves , do n't count on them during a game .
