o.n.e. 's 11 ounce coconut waters is number one .
it 's exactly like the original coconut water i remembered with the wonderful taste , smoothness and ability to quench your thirst .
also , it 's totally natural , with five electrolytes and more potassium than a banana ! which is often slightly surgary/salty .
