the first few times i used way too much ! it took a little while to find the right amount to add to ginger ale .
i find that exactly three drops per soda can is just right .
i reccomend you get a dropper bottle to measure it with .
the first few times i used this to add to my ginger ale soda to give it a more ginger taste .
