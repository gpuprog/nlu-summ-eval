the english breakfast tea from higgins & burke , is good : it 's basic , good tasting black tea -lrb- english breakfast blend -rrb- and is tasty .
i was n't blown away by the flavor , but it was good : i enjoyed the tea , it brewed up quickly in these nice tea bags -lrb- i recommend about one minute of brew time -rrb- , and then added a splash of cream .
