at first the spread looked like a standard , medium-priced hotel morning offering .
they had cereal , muffins , breads , and juices - but they included some hot items as well .
that was great , but once i saw the belgian waffle iron , i was delighted when my waffles at home ended up just as delicious as the ones at the restaurant .
