<brâ /> <brâ /> the hugest advantage to this system is the urine is separated from the ` litter ' and odor is greatly reduced .
the litter consist of pellets similar in shape/size to the wood-based natural litters , but they are of a hard clay , which does n't break down with moisture .
if the poo is dry , you can kind of shake it around in the scoop to knock off some of the pellets .
