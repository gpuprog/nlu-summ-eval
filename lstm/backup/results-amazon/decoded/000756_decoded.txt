julian whitaker 's <brÃ¢ /> glowing recommendation .
i found it at my local health food store and continue to keep it on hand .
it is great icy cold but is also good at room temperature , making it handy to toss in a bag or purse while going out and about for those who need a snack or have to miss a meal for one reason or another .
