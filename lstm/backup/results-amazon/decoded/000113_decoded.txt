i was under the assumption that since it was a 3lb bag , it would be the large fireballs .
i still have the container from the last time i ordered atomic fireballs and it had the weight listed as 3lbs so i thought i would be receiving 3 lbs of large fireballs .
i am still debating on whether to return them and search yet again for the ` large ' fireballs .
what a bummer because i love them too .
