like one other reviewer , i 'll probably just toss it in the trash and throw that money away because i do n't know anybody who would enjoy it .
with the first sip i was highly disappointed .
it has a very strong artificial flavor that does n't taste anything like french vanilla and it certainly does n't taste like coffee .
