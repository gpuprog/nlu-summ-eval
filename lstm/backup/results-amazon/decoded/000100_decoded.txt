i thought this pacific soymilk would be just the thing , but unfortunately the stuff tastes like latex paint and it has no emulsifier in it , so it separates into liquid and clumps of solids at the bottom .
even after vigorous shaking , i could n't get them to blend back together , and even if i could , i still could n't get past the taste .
i usually drink silk soymilk and really like the taste , but it 's hard to find plain soymilk in single-serving cartons '
