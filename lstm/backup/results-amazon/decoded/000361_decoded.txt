maple syrup is thicker , not true maple syrup .
she bought the smallest bottle i could find at the store and i thought it tasted horrible and went back to my pancake syrup .
this time i actually purchased with the master cleanse .
maybe because i 'm so used to my pancake syrup that is thicker , i will order more in the future .
