<brâ /> my favorite coffee is now well over $ 57 a 5 lb bag , so i decided to try this and it was great-i like a low acid but very robust , dark cup of <brâ /> coffee and this fits the bill .
what can i say-the price is right too .
while this coffee is not fresh roasted when you order and then shipped-it comes pretty close because the flavor is so good .
