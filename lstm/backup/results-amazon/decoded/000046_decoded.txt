by a miracle , i found zico pure premium coconut water and it has become my preferred drink .
i have intercystial , which is inflammation of the bladder , and since i started drinking zico , my symptoms have vanished .
i absolutely love the chocolate flavor ... coconut and chocolate are the best combination .
