the only redeeming quality i can see so far is the product packaging -lrb- +1 star -rrb- , which is very attractive and lively .
verdict on magnum jamaican blue mountain blend : ugh , do n't bother .
on top of that , it also tastes extremely weak , no matter how high of a coffee to water ratio is used .
