i eat very little candy , but every once in a while i ca n't resist .
i doubt that i 'll finish the bag .
oh well , maybe it 's for the best .
i tired of them after the third .
they have a bit of an illusion of candy , but just do n't match up .
oh well , sometimes i 'll try a candy substitute and on my last trip to the grocery store , i spotted some bags -lrb- 2.75 ounces -rrb- of werther 's original hard candy .
