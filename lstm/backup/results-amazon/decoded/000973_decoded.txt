so after reading about the jolokia pepper i eagerly ordered this sauce , paying through the nose given the extra shipping cost .
even ten drops of the stuff in a sauce on my own plate does n't do much for me .
so i doubt i will be ordering this again .
suggestion to the makers , if they ever read these comments : dispense with the labelling which makes it seem like a rival to the `` dave 's '' line of hot sauces when it .
just market it on the basis of the taste .
