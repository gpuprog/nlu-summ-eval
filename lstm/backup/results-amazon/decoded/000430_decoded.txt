<brâ /> <brâ edit : and just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it , black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat .
unfortunately i put a chip in my mouth before i saw the hole , she was sent 3 week past `` fresh by date '' stock .
chips are noticeably not fresh in taste .
