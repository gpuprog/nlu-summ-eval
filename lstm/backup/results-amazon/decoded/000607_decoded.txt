i 've even hunted for online recipes for this cornbread , some are close , but they 're just not the same .
usually for christmas i 'll even ask family in the states to send me some in the mail because shipping for this item is usually so expensive .
now i 've managed to order some in , and i 'm so happy ! i 've made several batches already , some my husband ate completely .
it tastes so good and it 's so easy to make ! thank you for making this item available on amazon
