timothy 's rainforest expresso decaf makes a strong cup with a smoother taste .
this variety is almost undrinkable ! but tully 's roast has an acrid , burnt taste that i do n't enjoy .
i understand that the french roasts have a stronger taste .
i 've used starbucks french roast in the past in my drip coffee maker .
