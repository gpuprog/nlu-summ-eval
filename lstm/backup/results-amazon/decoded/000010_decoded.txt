fajita seasoning i 'd expect it to have more kick .
i find myself reaching for the taco seasoning we bought from them instead , and adding some chili powder or black pepper as well .
it 's not that it tastes bad , but for fajita maybe it 's just me , but i do n't really like this seasoning all that much .
