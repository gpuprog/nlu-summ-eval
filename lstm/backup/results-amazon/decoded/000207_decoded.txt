at first bite , i realized there were chunks of sweet mango , the intense mango flavor hit my palate , and it tasted real , not at all artificial .
this was followed by a bit of cruncy coconut which just perfectly tempered the sweet mango .
the macadamia 's added a stronger crunch with just a hint of honey .
