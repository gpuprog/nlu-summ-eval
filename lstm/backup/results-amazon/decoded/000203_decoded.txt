<brâ /> <brâ /> i love them because they are easy to break up into 10 + pieces for training since they are soft .
also , compared to most other snacks they are healthy with duck meat being the first ingredient .
although i would n't consider these treats to be the healthiest you can get , they are certainly not the unhealthiest .
we use the duck flavor because my dog has diarrhea when he has chicken , beef , or salmon and these work for him .
