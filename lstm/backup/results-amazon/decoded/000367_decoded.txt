the smokehouse chicken breast strips because they were made in the u.s.a. .
they are so hard , my dog can not chew them , and if i break them -lrb- which is hard to do -rrb- .
it is a wasted $ 22.99 , as i will not give them to her .
how can you sell something so dangerous .
there are not very many `` strips '' , mostly pieces .
