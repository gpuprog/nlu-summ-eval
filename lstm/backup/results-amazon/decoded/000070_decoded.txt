looking at the label the only benefits it had was 4 % of your dv vitamin c. i 'd say they are cheaper ... and i 've found they lack quality too .

looking at the label the only benefits it had actual strawberry seeds which tells me there are actually strawberries in them -lrb- as well as one full apple -rrb- .
