the appearance of this bread is nothing like a loaf of french bread .
but after a bite i decided that looks just are n't that important when it tastes like this ! i was a little doubtful it would taste that good due to the looks of it , but after the other gf breads i 've tried .
i 'm excited to try more from this line .
