since breakfast is the most important meal of the day , i start mine with a ` smoothie ' , containing wheatgrass as a base , and then add fresh fruit , -lrb- your choice -rrb- , flaxseed , fresh spinach and 1 - 1/2 cups of pom juice .
scoop of wheatgrass ... mix in blender and drink .
en-er-gee , soooooo good !! .
