if you want the real benefits of chocolate , it has to be raw -lrb- never heated over 118 -rrb- and organic and you 're going to pay through the nose .
you can get the raw cacao nibs from navitas on amazon for much less than whole foods , but the nibs taste like a ** .
if you buy this , i hope you enjoy your irremovable milk residue chocolate .
