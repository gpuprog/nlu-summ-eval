this is the second bag of pistachios and there 's some wonderfully bad surprises in this batch .
it did n't help that the pistachios had several impossible small butt cracks to try to open .
just to clarify the first bag i purchased was great , but there 's something wrong with quality control if i 'm tasting feet in my bag of pistachios .
it did n't help that the pistachios had the fortune to sample the flavors of shoe , shampoo , ham , and frozen pizza in this bag .
