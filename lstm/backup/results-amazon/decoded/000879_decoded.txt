the 5 lb bag has a little moisture-capturing device so the sugar crystals do n't turn to goo .
nobody turns them down , not even the people who are sour enough already .
again , this is a product that i once found in a store , but then it vanished and amazon was the only place where i could find it .
if you do n't know where to go for something , go to amazon .
