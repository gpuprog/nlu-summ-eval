the kind fruit & nut bars would normally get 5 stars from me , but my experience by ordering them through amazon brought them down a few stars .
as it turns out , the case i have now was delivered in september 2012 and expires in october 2013 , so they should be fine .
hopefully , this was just a fluke and the next case will be better .
if not , they 're getting returned and i 'll find another source .
