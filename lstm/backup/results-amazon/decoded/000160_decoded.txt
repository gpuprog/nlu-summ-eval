great cereal , worth the risks , and highly recommended -lrb- just eat with caution -rrb- ! this is a great pairing of flavors to spice up raisin bran with that should not be missed if your stomach turning into an atomic bomb .
of course like anything else , if used responsibly these effects can be avoided .
yet here i sit eating my fourth bowl ... and in ten minutes my world will be upside down .
still , great cereal , even at the risk of it 's somewhat serious side effects .
