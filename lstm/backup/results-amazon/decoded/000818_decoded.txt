we have purchased these before from costco and they were moist , the ones we purchased online were hard as rocks .
i believe they may have been a very old product and i was very unsatisfied with them even though the dogs ate them .
i have no idea how you can verify a fresh product when ordered online .
i ordered two bags of yummy chummies and they arrived promptly .
however they should have been shipped with a hammer enclosed to break them '
