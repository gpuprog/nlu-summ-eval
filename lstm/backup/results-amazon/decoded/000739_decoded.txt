the unique caramelized onion , sweet/savory flavor of this amazing ` king ' fruit .
i wish i had access to fresh durian so i could compare , but for now i 'm satisfied with this .
i never thought i 'd try this fruit , but thanks to this freeze dried option i got the chance and wow - a pleasant surprise ! i was prepared for the worst after seeing so many people 's reactions on tv .
