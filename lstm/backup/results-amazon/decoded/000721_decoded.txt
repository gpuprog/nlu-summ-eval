after the taste test i am probably going to stop the auto-ship function as they are too sweet , especially for a `` healthy '' snack .
do n't get me wrong , they are pretty tasty and somewhat healthy but just a little too sweet for me .
knock some of the sugar out and it would be an excellent health snack .
