this is the first coffee i tried when i got my keurig .
i thought maybe i had n't cleaned the keurig enough so i put through more water and brewed another cup ... same horrible taste .
i would not recommend this brand to anyone .
i thought maybe i had n't cleaned the keurig enough so disappointed in the flavor ; tasted like plastic -lrb- like drinking bottled water that was left in a hot car -rrb- .
