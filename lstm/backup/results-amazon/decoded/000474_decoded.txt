the original marathon bar was a much thinner braid with no lumpy parts .
however , the original marathon bar claimed they were like my much beloved , horribly missed marathon bars .
now , what they lack in texture , they almost make up for in quality .
this is nice cadbury milk-chocolate and caramel , not the brittle , purposely soured milk of m&m / mars .
