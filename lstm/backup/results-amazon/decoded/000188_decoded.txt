the recipe calls for frying the meat in a pan until half done .
following the very simple directions , i started by cutting the roast into thin strips and some chunks , nothing bigger than a silver dollar .
i then stir fried the venison in oil in a steel wok until done since my wife does not care for any pink in her meat .
