this is the favorite cereal ever and was disappointed when my local grocery quit selling it .
i have tried multiple healthy cereals since to try and replace it but keep coming back to this .
glad to find it reasonably priced here .
lots of cinnamon taste but not overly sweet , my teenage son fights me for the open box .
