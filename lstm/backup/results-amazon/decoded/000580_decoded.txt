in fact , i think they could 've left off the drizzle for fewer calories or put fewer pieces in the bag to get the calorie count below 130 .
if they did this , it still would make for a good treat .
at first i saw 130 calories and this small bag and thought it just would n't be worth it , but the popcorn is so flavorful and the texture so good that i 'm planning on keeping a box on hand .
