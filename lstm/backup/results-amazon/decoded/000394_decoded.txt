since id only ever bought this specific candy in germany , i assumed that they were shipping from overseas which is the highest ive ever had to pay for shipping .
maybe the seller incurs a lot of import fees and that could raise the price that they charge for shipping but i still think that almost three times the price of the actual item is again , rediculous .
