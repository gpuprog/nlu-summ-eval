since then , being the miso snob that i am , it has been unimaginable to me to try any instant variety .
but i have to say that when i finally did break down and try kikkoman instant tofu miso soup , i was amazed to find that it was practically indistinguishable in flavor and consistency from miso soup made from the actual paste .
