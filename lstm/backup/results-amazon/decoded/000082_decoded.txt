i may look at comporable brands that are less costly , since she eats any type of treat thrown her way .
i am lucky that she is not picky .
i love greenies as a treat for my american staffy .
she has never gotten sick after eating these treats .
they are very expensive and even at a discounted price , at $ 1 + per treat .
