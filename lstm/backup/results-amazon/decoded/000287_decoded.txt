the person i gave it to be 100 % kona coffee , what was a gift , the person i have ordered , i am not satisfied with that offer.i was very dissappointed .
they said i could return it if unopened.obviously i could not do that.what they offered me was a discount on what i will be ordering from them anymore.this is very unfortunate as they do have a good product .
no problems.i do n't think i will be ordering from them anymore.this is very unfortunate as they do have a good product .
