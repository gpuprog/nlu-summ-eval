i 've complained about the expiration dates when ordering from amzaon .
she 's 9 yrs old and i thought the glucosamine would be beneficial to her .
so even though the dog food is going to expire in 4 months , i 've ended up having to give it away to someone else as she just looks at the food and back at me like `` really you expect me to eat this , i will say that she is a very picky eater .
so it maybe great for others , just not for my dog .
