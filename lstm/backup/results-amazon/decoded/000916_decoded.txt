gloria jean makes great coffee to begin with and hazelnut coffee in k-cup form is fantastic .
in the time that i 've owned a keurig brewer , this is hands-down one of the best coffees i 've tried , and i 'll definitely be ordering it again .
just wish this 50-pack came in differently-sized/designed box so it would store more easily in a kitchen cabinet .
