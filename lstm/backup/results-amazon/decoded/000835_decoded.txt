when i saw this , i saw two things -lrb- hawaiian blend , and hazelnut -rrb- so i immediately wanted to try it .
so i bought it , and brewed some as soon as i could and i really , really like this coffee .
when i saw this coffee seems to have the perfect balance between the coffee taste and the flavor which is awesome because many times flavored coffees taste just like a regular coffee blend .
