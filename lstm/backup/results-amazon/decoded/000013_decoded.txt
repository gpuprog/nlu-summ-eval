nancy walsh was first introduced to the red rice & beans chips in my hometown of bethlehem , pa. .
when i moved to north carolina i was unable to find these chips in my local area .
on my trips back home , i would buy a bunch of bags to bring back with me to nc .
then i discovered that i could order them on-line and life was great .
