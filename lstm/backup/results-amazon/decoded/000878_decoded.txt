so i got the idea that i could take a empty 20 oz coke bottle and fill it half way with kibble and maybe she would graduate to the tug a jug eventually .
she loves the plastic soda bottles , but still ignores this toy .
she recommend starting with a soda bottle and only moving to this if they regularly destroy the soda bottle .
