the variety pack has two flavors and styles of cat food .
each of my cats , one of whom is a fairly picky eater , both seemed to enjoy this food and ate it straight way .
once again , my picky eater just lapped up the sauce , and my other big guy , who eats anything , no matter how hungry he was .
