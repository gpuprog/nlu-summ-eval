when i opened my box , one bottle was only 3/4 full and the other 1/4 was spilled out all over the packaging .
unfortunately returns are n't accepted on this product and all i am left with is a sticky disappointment - mainly because i have less nectar .
but when i just thought i 'd give a heads up and put it out there in hope i could possibly get a reimbursement of some kind .
