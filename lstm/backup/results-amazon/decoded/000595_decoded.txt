the trainer recommended these treats for training because they 're small and the dog does n't have to stop and chew between activities .
also , these chicken and salmon treats seem to have healthier ingredients than most other dog treats .
maybe dogs do n't need the grains , but the protein-based recipe seems like a better choice .
