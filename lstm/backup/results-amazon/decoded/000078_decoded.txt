after feeding my dog this to my dog when she was a few months old because the poor thing seemed to be allergic to everything and i could n't figure out what was making her ill .
plus , she looks great ! i 'm very pleased by this product .
plus , my dog continues to enjoy this food and has not had any allergy issues .
