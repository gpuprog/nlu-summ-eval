<brÃ¢ /> /> this is a refreshing drink , and a nice size if you want something less than a regular 12 oz can .
there is very little after taste , but the carbonation is just right , not too strong or too weak .
the 8.4 oz drink has 90 calories and 21g of sugar , it does contain 70 % fruit juice which can be pretty sweet .
