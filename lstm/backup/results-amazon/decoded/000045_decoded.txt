if you are the family that tries to make healthy choices and have healthier alternitives then this is a great after dinner dessert that i feel good about giving him and myself .
they are satisfying and filling and my whole family loves them .
if you eat nothing but white flour products and ca n't get used to or absolutly hate whole grains and their taste and texture .
