if you want a very , very gentle scrub then this may be for you , but for those of you who have used the st.ives apricot scrub , and want something more effective then you should look elsewhere .
on the plus side , it is partially organic , and natural , and as i mentioned earlier it smells nice .
i just saw a review about how it smelled like rotten pineapples , and how it caused a pimple outbreak on the reviewer-i 'm guessing it was either expired .
