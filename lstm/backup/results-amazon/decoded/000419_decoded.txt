<brâ /> <brâ i do like how convenient the drinks are , they would fit nicely into my husband 's lunchbox for work .
however , my husband has loved ever illy product and i guess i just do n't like them .
so i 'll give this a 3 ; my rating would have been a 1 but his would be a 5 so we 'll split the difference .
