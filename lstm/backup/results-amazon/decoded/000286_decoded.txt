bulk bags were in good condition and the fenugreek itself was among the best i 've encountered .
for other uses -lrb- ie , lactating women -rrb- , i 'd go with the organic variety instead .
in fact , now that i know the quality of this fenugreek seed , my next purchase will be organic from the same company .
delicious , very nice price and fast shipping .
