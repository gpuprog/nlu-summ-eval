after i found it was in my mail box , i discovered it was only 1 pint -lrb- 16oz -rrb- .
i assumed for $ 14.95 + $ 6.76 shipping -lrb- $ 21.71 total -rrb- that i was getting a gallon .
however nowhere in the product description or reviews does it tell you how much your getting .
so do n't waist your money on this rip-off ! take my advise and buy the gallon size at http://www.amazon.com/paragon-coconut-popcorn-popping-gallon/dp/b002yli9e2/ref=pd_cp_ba_1_im <brÃ¢ it is only $ 6 more .
