turkey is their favorite , which is why i 'm posting the review here .
after spending hours researching pet foods on the internet , i was completely shocked .
it did n't take long for us to settle on wellness because of its premium ingredients and stellar reputation .
they love the turkey , chicken , and turkey/salmon varieties , which are all grain free .
