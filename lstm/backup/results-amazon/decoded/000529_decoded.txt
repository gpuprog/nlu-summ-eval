individually wrapped spices that will stay fresh longer , are organic and most of all , useful for cooking what i cook .
the next time you have to use a spice , use it , but someday , when you are cooking something special and want to have the spices be of the best quality , look at the date on that spice - you 'll be amazed how old it is ! what a shame ! i have lots of spices .
