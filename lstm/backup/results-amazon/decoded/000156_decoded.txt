flour is a peruvian varietal packaged in washington state , near where i lived last year .
it is `` from lynwood , wa , usa , '' in my suburban jewish mother opinion , this product `` should '' not be $ 30 a small box , but it is properly milled .
if it 's kosher/vegan add 1/2 * , it will crumble , you need fine grind or a grinder .
