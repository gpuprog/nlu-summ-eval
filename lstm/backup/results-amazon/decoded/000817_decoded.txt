butterscotch schnapps is another one of those flavors that i adore .
in my drinking days , butterscotch schnapps was my go-to drink .
i love it with a bit of milk or hot cocoa ... oh yes , she loves it and it makes me think of him ... or maybe i 'm just homesick this week .
i want to sip on this all day , but not too rich .
