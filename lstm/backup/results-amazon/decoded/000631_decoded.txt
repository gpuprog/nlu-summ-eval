i received a keurig machine for christmas and was eager to sample all of the coffees that were included .
unfortunately the caribou blend was absent in my sampler .
i can sum up my experience with one word ... `` wow ! '' this coffee is very smooth but loaded with flavor , even on the largest cup setting .
i would say this is one of the best , if not the best , coffees i 've ever tasted .
