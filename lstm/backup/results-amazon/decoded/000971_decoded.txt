my 13 yr pin suddenly stopped eating her regular brand food.she went many days not eating so i switched to this brand and she went beserk for it.i now buy it from amazon because it 's a little cheaper and i do n't have to hassle running back and forth to the pet store wasting my gas and paying more.this is a highly rated pet food without the by-products store bought dog food has.my little girl seems to be more active since i 've been feeding her this brand .
