the natural foods / healthy food sections at the grocery stores and sometimes in the tea sections at some stores , but lately it was getting more difficult to find .
it is a better deal to buy it in bulk on-line , plus having it shipped to your door is wonderful ... and then be dissappointed if they do not have any in stock .
overall , it helps me get through the tough time before my period starts .
