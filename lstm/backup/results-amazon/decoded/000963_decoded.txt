when my mother told us that a friend of hers loved this bread mix , my sister went out and bought a bread machine and ordered the pamela 's wheat-free/gluten-free bread mix .
she wanted to try one and fully expected to give the rest to mom 's friend .
much to her surprise , this bread was better than good .
it has the taste and texture of a dense whole grain bread .
