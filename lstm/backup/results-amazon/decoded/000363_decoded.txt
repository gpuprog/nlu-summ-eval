i eat sugar free candy all the time and lycasin has always been fine .
i only ate 5 little gummies and i got very sick , my head was fuzzy and i was so dizzy i could not see straight or stand and had to lie down for some time .
also , my speech was slurred .
i had some flatulence and it was very toxic smelling like chemicals .
is it the artificial flavors or colors ... i do n't know and i do n't care .
no more for me .
