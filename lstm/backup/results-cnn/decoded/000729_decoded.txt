isis militants might be just hours away from taking the key iraqi city of ramadi .
fierce fighting has engulfed ramadi , which lies only about 70 miles -lrb- 113 kilometers -rrb- west of baghdad and is the capital of anbar province , iraq 's sunni heartland .
essawi , the deputy head of the anbar provincial council , told cnn from inside the city wednesday that it 's unclear how much longer troops can hold their front lines against the isis offensive .
