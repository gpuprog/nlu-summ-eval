american jennifer stewart says she and her husband , joseph naaman , booked felix on their etihad airways flight from abu dhabi to new york 's john f. kennedy international airport on april 1 .
felix was able to get loose , stewart said , because the cat 's plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either during the flight or the transfer from the airplane to the pickup area .
at least one of the corners of the case appeared partially collapsed .
