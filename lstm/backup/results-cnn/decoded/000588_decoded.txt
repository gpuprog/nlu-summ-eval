marion `` suge '' knight pleads not guilty to murder charges related to a fatal hit-and-run incident .
his attorney asked the court to further reduce knight 's bail , now set at $ 10 million , but los angeles county judge ronald coen denied the request .
the judge lowered knight 's bail earlier this month , to $ 10 million from $ 25 million , after defense lawyers called the $ 25 million figure excessive for the circumstances .
