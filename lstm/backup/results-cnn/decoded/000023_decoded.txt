sky watchers in western north america are in for a treat : a nearly five-minute total lunar eclipse .
it started at 3:16 a.m. pacific daylight time , when the moon began moving into earth 's shadow .
while people west of the mississippi river will have the best view , but it wo n't be visible across the nation .
