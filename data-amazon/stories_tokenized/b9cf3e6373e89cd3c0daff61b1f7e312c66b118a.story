This Cinnamon Oat Cluster cereal looks like granola , but is dryer and lower in fat and calories than my favorite granola , Bear Naked All Natural Granola , Fruit and Nut , 12-Ounce Pouches -LRB- Pack of 6 -RRB- . In fact this whole grain cereal by Kind Healthy Grains has half the fat . So for everyday consumption , this cereal is quite tasty . Another characteristic of this cereal worth noting -- the wholesome taste of the whole grain blend really comes through . <br /> <br /> I like to put cereal with fruit and yogurt . The nice this about this product is that it stays crunchy in milk or yogurt . So if crunch is something you like in your cereal , this one is a real keeper .
