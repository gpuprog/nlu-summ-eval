My son is 11 month and only just now cutting his first tooth . It 's hard to find snacks on-the-go for him that do n't require teeth . I recently came across the Plum Organics Teensy Fruits and took a chance since they were only $ 3-ish . The price might be a tad high for what you actually get but the snack is great . The fruit is pretty much the size of a raisin and they are pretty tasty . They 're not as thick and chewy as a normal fruit snack which is good since he does n't have teeth . I 'll probably keep them in the house a little longer for a nice alternative to cheerios when we go out , but once he has some teeth we 'll move on to something else .
