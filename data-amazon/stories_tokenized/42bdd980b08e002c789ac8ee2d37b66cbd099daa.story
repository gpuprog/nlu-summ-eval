I ordered what was supposed to be 100 % Kona Coffee , what I received was 100 % Arabica Beans.This was a gift , the person I gave it to had already opened one bag.I spoke to the company and they said I could return it if unopened.Obviously I could not do that.What they offered me was a discount on what I had originally ordered , I am not satisfied with that offer.I was very dissappointed , I have ordered with this company several times with no problems.I do n't think I will be ordering from them anymore.This is very unfortunate as they do have a good product .
