This is my second Illy coffee product and I guess I just do n't like them . They are too strong and bitter-tasting for me . I 'm not a lover of overly strong coffee flavors , I like them mild and unobtrusive . However , my husband has loved ever Illy product that I 've given him to try , and he IS a coffee drinker . He likes anything coffee . So I 'll give this a 3 ; my rating would have been a 1 but his would be a 5 so we 'll split the difference . <br /> <br /> I do like how convenient the drinks are , they would fit nicely into my husband 's lunchbox for work .
