These treats truly are as pure as you can get -- 100 % beef liver and nothing else . This also means that they 're grain free , which is fantastic for dogs with gas problems . Switching from other -LRB- high-quality -RRB- treats to PureBites liver reduced the frequency and potency of my dog 's rear-end emissions by about 90 percent . Both my dogs love these treats . The only , minor drawback is that the bottom of the bag tends to have a little pile of tiny bits and pieces of treats -- at that point , I 'll pour out a little pile for each of my dogs and they lick them up like candy .
