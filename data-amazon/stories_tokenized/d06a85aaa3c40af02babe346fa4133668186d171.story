My 13 yr old min pin suddenly stopped eating her regular brand food.She went many days not eating so i switched to this brand and she went BESERK FOR IT.I now buy it from Amazon because it 's a little cheaper and i do n't have to hassle running back and forth to the pet store wasting my gas and paying more.This is a highly rated pet food without the BY-PRODUCTS store bought dog food has.My little girl seems to be more active since i 've been feeding her this brand and I feel better knowing she is getting better nutrition ...
