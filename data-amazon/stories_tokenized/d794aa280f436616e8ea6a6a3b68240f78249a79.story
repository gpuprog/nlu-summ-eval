Indian food is a guilty pleasure for me , since nobody else in my home likes to eat it . So I was pleasantly surprised with this particular entree . The sauce has a kick but with rice it is not overbearing . I do n't believe it has coriander or anise , two spices that I can not stand eating and have noticed in some of the other dishes . The vegetables and tofu are tender and tasty , but rather scarce in the package , hence one less star . If I were to pour it in a bowl and compare it to the one displayed on the package , the difference in sauce vs. vegetables/tofu would be laughable ! But it tastes deliciously authentic and it definitely satisfies my Indian food fix !!
