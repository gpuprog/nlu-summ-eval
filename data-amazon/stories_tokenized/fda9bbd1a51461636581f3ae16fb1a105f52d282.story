Everyone is right !! Wish the company would go back to the canister , really enjoy the coffee . Package is hard to open , too small an amount , have to drink 1/2 a cup or use 2 packs . 20 packs do n't last long so you have to store 8 boxes in order to have a supply . Gave it 3 stars because of the package style , the coffee is 5 star . I 'm sure the company wo n't listen to the consumer report and go back to the canister because they 're making a lot more money this way .
