I finished off a package in under 10 minutes - these things are delicious ! I 've always been a fan of red licorice -LRB- Twizzlers and the like -RRB- , but these Pomegranate ones are much tastier . Slightly tangy and sweet , I would recommend these twists to anyone who loves licorice and loves Pomegranate .
