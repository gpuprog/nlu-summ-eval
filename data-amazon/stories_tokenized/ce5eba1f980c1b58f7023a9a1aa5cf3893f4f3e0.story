I have tried all of the flavors and have to say that chocolate is my least favorite . However , the vanilla , pb creme , and wild berry are all awesome . The wild berry is almost like a strawberry birthday cake made into a wafer bar . There is a pb fudge that is just ok . They should sell a variety box ! Also , get these shipped in cooler months . And I recommend storing in freezer . :-RRB- And i forgot the cookies n creme ... . Also delicious !
