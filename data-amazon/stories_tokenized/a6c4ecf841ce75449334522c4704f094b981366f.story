I highly recommend this for anyone doing anything sporty . It not only has the water content you need , but it 's chalk full of electrolytes . Those looking solely for the coconut water might be surprised at the taste of this -LRB- very chocolate-y -RRB- , but it still tastes great and has all the benefits you 'd want . It also blends fantastically with chocolate or vanilla protein powders for those seeking a nice mixer for protein shakes .
