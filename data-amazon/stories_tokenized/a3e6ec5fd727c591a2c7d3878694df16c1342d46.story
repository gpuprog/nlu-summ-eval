I never thought I 'd try this fruit , but thanks to this freeze dried option I got the chance and wow - a pleasant surprise ! I was prepared for the worst after seeing so many people 's reactions on TV . I happen to love the unique caramelized onion , sweet/savory flavor of this amazing ` king ' fruit . I wish I had access to fresh durian so I could compare , but for now I 'm satisfied with this . I just wish it were a little cheaper and easier to find .
