Many of Bahlsen 's cookies are too sweet and floury for my taste , but these light flaky cookies do n't taste stale and are not too rich but are nice and do not taste like sugared cardboard . I do n't crave these but when you eat them , you realize that these are better than the average boxed cookies and unexpectedly delicate and fresh tasting given the supermarket price .
