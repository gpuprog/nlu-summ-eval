I 've wanted to try truffles for quite a while , but have n't found anything in my budget until now . I 'm already a big fan of this company , and their other salts , so knew I was off to a good start when I found this . It is VERY good . The truffle flavor is there -LRB- sort of an ` umami ' quality -RRB- , but not overbearing . I can use the right amount of salt for my taste , and get `` enough '' truffle flavor to notice it . I had also ordered a white truffle oil -LRB- not the same company -RRB- , and it 's `` ok '' ... but this black truffle salt is REALLY good - already have 2 more in my cart !!
