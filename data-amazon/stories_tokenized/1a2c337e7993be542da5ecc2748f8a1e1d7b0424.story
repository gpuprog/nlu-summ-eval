My dog suffers from an auto immune disorder which causes him to have to take a lot of meds . He also is on a novel protein diet and ca n't have many `` normal '' dog treats or food . After trying a million ways to get those pills in him I found these in the reduced allergen flavor . Yes , they stink horribly . But suddenly meal time is a treat and I could n't be happier ! Just wish more came in a bag and they were cheaper .
