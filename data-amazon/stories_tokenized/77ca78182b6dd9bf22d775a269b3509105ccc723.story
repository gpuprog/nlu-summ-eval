I 'm a vegetarian who has tried just about all varieties of meat alternatives , and this unique product has one purpose in my life . I use it to make a chicken/tuna salad that the texture is perfect for . I mash things up a bit and the taste and unique texture is perfect . There are many other better chicken alternatives for other recipes/uses , but this is really perfect if you are looking to make a chicken or tuna salad type recipe/sandwich , etc. . .
