For anyone who does any cooking that involves poppy seeds , it makes total sense to buy in semi-bulk . <br /> <br /> For the cost of two pounds of these high quality Frontier seeds , you might be able to buy a few ounces -LRB- 2-3 bottles -RRB- from your local grocery store . <br /> <br /> There are many great recipes from Eastern Europe that use lots and lots of these tasty seeds . I have n't bothered trying to buy in super-bulk yet , like the 70 lbs bags ! But I might in the near future :-RRB- <br /> <br /> I should offer a warning to people who are subjected to random urinalyses : at work , in the military or on probation : some of the recipes that call for a large amounts of poppy seeds -LRB- like Hungarian `` Beiglis '' -RRB- can cause a positive result for opiate use . <br /> <br /> I run these tests for people in my department and for some employees , it can cause serious problems , so please be careful ! I unofficially tested myself after eating a Czech Kolache , and my pee was positive for opiates for four days !! -LRB- using the OPI2000 indicator kit -RRB- <br /> <br /> Probably best not to bring these dishes in to work and share them with your co-workers ! They covered this on Myth-Busters I heard , and its absolutely true .
