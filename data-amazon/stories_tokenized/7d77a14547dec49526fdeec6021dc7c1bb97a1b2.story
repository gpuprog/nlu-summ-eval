This stuff is incredible . I picked up a few bottles for my husband who 's a big Marley fan and also happens to enjoy tea ... Before he got to them , I had about half a bottle one afternoon while we were playing with our kids . I sat down on the couch and ended up taking a nap -LRB- which is something I never ever do -RRB- . Guess I should have read the label first ! I thought it would just relax me , not put me to sleep - so now I drink a half bottle before bed . Sounds cheesy , but it quiets my anxious mind . I sleep SO well with this tea and I wake up feeling happy and refreshed -LRB- not weighed down and grumpy as I usually am in the morning -RRB- . Keep in mind , I 'm a lightweight at 117lbs and 5 ' 4 . <br /> <br /> NOTE : I found this at the store at 1.50 / bottle ... I 'm really bummed that Amazon jacked up the price here .
