We have two cats who are addicted to treats . <br /> Okay , we made them that way . We fed them Temptations for years , before we really took the time to read the labels and understand what the ingredients really were . That brand is about the same as flavored potato chips for humans - flavor enhancers are added to make us crave the item . Temptations does the same for your cat . No wonder they did n't want to stop eating them ! <br /> <br /> Anyway , we were on the hunt for a healthier treat that was n't full of kitty junk food . <br /> Both our cats love chicken and could care less about tuna or fish flavors , so this was one of the items we tried . <br /> The ingredients are top-notch , and the treat 's size is really good for cats . <br /> <br /> However , while both cats get excited about the bag being opened -LRB- like a can opener sound or popping the lid on wet cat food -RRB- , <br /> I could swear I hear them sigh when they see this bag ! While they do eat these , it is n't a favorite by any means . Both will eat a few pieces then walk away , almost unheard of in all previous treat feeds of all brands . I can leave a few out and they 'll get eaten , but it is probably out of boredom , not because they want them . One of our favorite games with both cats is tossing a treat for them to catch . They both love to do this , but are too bored to play catch with these treats . While I am glad that these do not contain the kitty version of MSG , it also needs to have something more appealing to the cats too . <br /> <br /> There is enough chicken in this to make it a decent product for your cat . However , there also does n't seem to be a lot of flavor , in their opinion . While I did not buy mine at Amazon , no matter where you shop , Halo treats are pretty costly , given what <br /> they are - little round pieces of cat food . <br /> <br /> We wo n't be buying them again . For a few dollars more , we can get a 3-lb sack of very healthy cat food that we can use as treats instead . Right now , we are using Blue Buffalo cat food as their treat . They both adore it , it is full of healthy ingredients too -LRB- despite being more grains than I really think cats need -RRB- , and you get a lot more value . We also use Eukanuba dry food as treats , and both of those brands are very popular with both of our cats . <br /> <br /> So , while everyone 's cats have different likes/dislikes just like we humans do , I 'd put my money into some other brand . <br /> If this one came way down in price , then it would be an okay value as an extra treat . <br /> But , for the premium pricing on a bag of treats , you can do just as well by your cat with other brands . <br /> There is nothing really special about these , and do n't have either the flavor or fragrance to get our cats too excited about them . <br /> I think we were all a little disappointed with the Halo chicken treats .
