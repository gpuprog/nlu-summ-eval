Wish I could say these are fantastic , but I ca n't . They are extremely high in sugar , with the first three ingredients being : corn syrup , sugar , high fructose corn syrup . They do n't have any artificial colors or flavors , but the flavors , of which there are 6 , are very subtle . They do n't jump out at you , so unless you eat them one by one , and really try hard to distinguish each flavor , it 's hard to tell . They are very soft , almost too soft .
