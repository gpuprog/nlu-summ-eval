The taste I am looking for is reminiscent of old , small town theaters with fantastic , melty , buttery popcorn - not that of today 's mainstream digital 3D multiplexes . <br /> <br /> That said , this popping oil colors the popcorn the perfect shade of yellow , despite the oil 's orange appearance , but we 're eating it , not putting it on display . Old time theater popcorn has a rich buttery taste even before adding butter . This oil adds very little , if any , flavor . Being coconut oil , the kernels pop well and are tender , but it 's all style & no substance . I 'll be moving on to try the next brand of oil .
