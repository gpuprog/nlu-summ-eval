I took a chance with this product -LRB- even though there were n't enough good reviews -RRB- since they are cheaper than 5 hour energy . They did not work for me so I tried Red Rain which did work and was even cheaper . Red Rain DID work for me so I am done with 5 hour energy and 6 hour power . The ingredients are pretty close to 5 hour energy but someone is lying since it does n't work .

Did n't make the cut
