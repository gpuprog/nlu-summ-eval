If you close your eyes and try really hard , you * might * be able to pick up a feint hint of candy corn flavor in these Oreos . Otherwise , they just taste like overly sweet frosting and cheap cookies . -LRB- And let 's face it , that 's what Oreos basically are . -RRB- Despite all the Internet hype , these were a huge let-down . I hope the good people at Nabisco decide not to give these a repeat appearance next fall . <br /> <br /> It should go without saying , but do n't pay the absurd prices resellers are charging for this these . Heck , do n't even waste your money if you see at them at Target -LRB- the exclusive distributor of this product -RRB- ... it 's just not worth it .
