Our daughter needs a gluten-free diet . We 've `` taste tested '' lots of things . Lucky for us she is n't a picky eater , but she DOES know what she likes . And she LOVES these cookies . Great for lunches , great for snack ! And we have the peace of mind that it 's healthier than other -LRB- sugar laden -RRB- alternatives .
