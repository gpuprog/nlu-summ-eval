I have always used Greenies for my dogs . THese for seniors are wonderful . I have an elderly bulldog with really bad breath . She used to swallow the original Greenies whole so I quit buying them for her . She actually does chew these and eat them and they make a big difference in how her breath smells . Great product and the price is better than I have seen it in some local pet stores .
