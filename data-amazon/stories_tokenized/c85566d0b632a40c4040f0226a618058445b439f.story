I would like to say that I have never tried a flavor of jerky that I did n't like ... that was true until a few days ago . I wanted to try something different and decided to stray from my usual peppered beef . This was a mistake , I have to say this is the worst jerky/nuggets/meat product I have ever tried . From the smell to the taste , just not good . If you really want to give this stuff a whirl , I suggest you find a single pack . Do n't buy 4 of them like I did . One final note : taste is subjective , you may really love this stuff , I just did n't .
