I have gotten sick of these big companies selling us products that are filled with fake things . Even the sugar-free Heinz has fake sugar in it ! So I was totally excited when I found Annie 's Ketchup at Target . I was very close to making my own ... but this is basically the same thing ! I love it ! It 's got a little zip of tartness that makes it SO addicting ! I have a very hard time getting ketchup when we go out to eat now because it 's sooo sweet . Give it a try - and you will be saying Heinz who ?
