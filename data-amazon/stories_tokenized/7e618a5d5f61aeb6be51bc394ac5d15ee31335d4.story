This stuff is truly amazing . Previously I had chemotherapy and the drugs took just about all the hormones away , hence giving me hot flashes . Calm helped to restore the balance and get me back on track , since I was kind of young for menopause . It has also taken my monthly cycle from 30-45 days right down to 28 days . It really is a great product . Magnesium is also wonderful for helping the body absorb calcium . I have been taking it for almost 8 months and I would n't think of stopping .
