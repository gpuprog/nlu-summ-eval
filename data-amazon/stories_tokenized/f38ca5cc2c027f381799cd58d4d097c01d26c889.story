I 've tried all the Fiber One cereals . The one that tastes best out of the box is the one with raisins , but that one has more calories than the regular brand . That one makes a good trail mix if you 're hiking . The regular brand is a little bland , so I add fresh fruit to it . Sometimes blueberries , sometimes raspberries , sometimes I cut up a banana . I also buy bags of frozen blueberries or raspberries , thaw some out the night before and add them to the cereal in the morning . I end up with a really great tasting cereal . I 'm sure that the fruit I add makes the calorie and sugar count higher , but so what . I think at 14 grams of fiber per serving , it 's got the highest fiber of any cereal on the market . <br /> <br /> A great way to start the morning !
