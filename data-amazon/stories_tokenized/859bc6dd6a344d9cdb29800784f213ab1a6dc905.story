I love this product . I currently get it automatically monthly . But suddenly the price has more than doubled for the same thing . I realize this is from another company but I can get this cheaper in the local grocery stores . I am really disappointed . This is my favorite not so guilty pleasure . I am a lifetime Weight Watcher and have been using this for years to stay on plan . I hope Amazon can get a different supplier and reduce the price . <br /> <br /> Update : The price is back down !! Yea ! I now would give 5 stars . I love this stuff . As for being hard to dissolve , yes , but if you add a little water at first and stir well , then add gradually it is fine .
