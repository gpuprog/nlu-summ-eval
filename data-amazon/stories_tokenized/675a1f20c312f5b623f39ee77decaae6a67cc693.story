I 'm having a cup of this coffee as I am writing this review . It was the deal most of all that made me buy this Tully 's blend . I think Tully does make some of the best kcups I have had though . Love the Kona blend but now is quite expensive . This has a nice flavor to me but could be a bit stronger . That being said , if I get another deal on this blend , I will definately by it again .
