I enjoy puchasing Anchor Bar wing sauce . In case the reader does not know it , the Anchor Bar in Buffalo is the home of the Buffalo chicken wing . It was invented on the fly way back when . And Buffalo wings continue to be popular in Buffalo and elsewhere . <br /> <br /> The Anchor Bar still serves wings , although I have n't been there in many years -LRB- they used to have live jazz a couple nights each week , adding to the ambience -RRB- . My experience includes a helping of `` hot '' wings before seeing a hockey match featuring the Buffalo Sabres with some friends . And , yikes ! It burned , brought a huge amount of heat . The bottled `` hotter '' sauce that I had previously tried turns out to be more like a mild to medium batch of sauce . So I ordered the `` suicidal '' to see if it matched the actual hot sauce at the Bar . My son and I wimped out though , and mixed some hotter sauce with the suicidal . The end product did have some heat -- but nothing like actual hot sauce served at the Anchor Bar itself . Next time , my son and I will try chicken wings with ONLY the suicidal sauce and give it a fair test as to how close it comes the real hot sauce from the Bar . <br /> <br /> Anyhow , we enjoyed our chicken wings a lot with half hotter sauce and half suicidal . But the true test is yet to come !

Heat -- but not suicidal ?
