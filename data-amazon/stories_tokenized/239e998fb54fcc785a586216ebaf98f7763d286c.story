Flour is a Peruvian varietal packaged in Washington State , near Lynwood , near where I lived last year . It is `` from Lynwood , WA , USA . '' In my suburban Jewish Mother opinion , this product `` should '' not be $ 30 a small box , but it is properly milled -LRB- fine grind -RRB- and probably on a small mill by a lot of people devoted to quality , that part shows , *** for quality . It 's not USDA Organic minus * . Minus another * for price , and if it 's kosher/vegan add 1/2 * . -LRB- not kosher certified on box . -RRB- <br /> <br /> I did find medium grind USDA Organic corn meal only in the local organic chain store -LRB- New Seasons is the only local grocery-type store that has both 100 % organic produce and packaged foods , some `` traditional '' ones and for about 20 % more than `` traditional '' groceries , but a consistent stock , responsive management , friendly clerks ... and most importantly lots of stores they are all the same inside . -RRB- `` Medium '' grind will NOT make a good tortilla , it will crumble , you need fine grind or a grinder . The product being reviewed IS the fine grind . <br /> <br /> So why did i buy it ? it 's the right grind for tortillas with the tortilla maker i bought . <br /> <br /> The flavor is a bit different too , not corny if you compare with the GMO cheapo tortillas from the usual grocery store , but closer to the taste of a handmade organic tortilla you might find somewhere in a health food store like Eerewon -LRB- good luck with that , Erewon 's mostly in Los Angeles -RRB- or maybe Whole Foods , did not check there . If you 're in Berkeley , CA try Berkeley Bowl . If you 're in Washington or Texas , try Central Market . Trader Joe does not have organic corn tortillas as far as I know . I found one shop in my travels , ca n't remember which shop , so that 's why I am doing it myself . It 's more fun this way and they can be frozen . The idea is to make little dough-balls -LRB- great with kids , grandkids , kindergarteners -RRB- and smash them . <br /> <br /> So mix up the and distilled water and let it sit in fridge , then make appropriate dough ball corresponding to whatever size tortilla you want . It has to be cold but not frozen , like playdough for grilled breads . Also you want it about as thick as an old LP vinyl record , not too thin but not too thick , make the thickness of one ceramic bath tile . You 'll know right away if it 's too thin . If it 's not done in two minutes , it 's too thick . If you do n't have a cast iron press , use a rolling pin or an empty wine bottle . <br /> <br /> experiment with different flours , but always heat and grease the machine first , otherwise dough will STICK . Testing with a drop or two of oil or water works . I use organic flax or olive with a pastry brush , you want a thin coat of oil , then press . If you 're making tortillas , get the pan greased and heated , but also coat the tortilla press so the tortilla will press off , I do n't like plastic , a sandwich baggie is another method for those who ca n't have any oil . If you 're vegan use egg substitute for the pizzelle , post if that works . If you 're kosher , no problem , tortillas are paerve . <br /> <br /> The griddle or the pan has to be HOT and you have to watch it . no turning of the back , watch it or you will have a black tortilla or a well done pizzelle . <br /> <br /> It 's not a pancake , it cooks longer and texture is different . <br /> <br /> Pizzelle should take one minute tops if everything is set up , someday maybe I will make a youtube ... do n't hold your breath , you tube involves talking sound editing i do n't know what else skills I am not great at . <br /> <br /> In any event , both keep in the freezer and can be thawed when ready to use by leaving on counter for a few hours or even in a pinch in a toaster , and make good , cheap nutritious snacks , as long as healthy fats used and no sugar overload is in the pizzelle or dairy high fat cheesy stuff poured on top of either bread , because they are both specialty breads and best with a bit of something but also good by themselves if fresh . <br /> <br /> since first posting i notice this http://www.amazon.com/Regular-finely-ground-perfect-recipes/dp/B0006N2PE0/ref=pd_sbs_gro_5 and others with lower prices , i do n't know if it is same quality , fresher , etc. but if you want FRESH , buy whole dry corn cut off cob yourself and mill it with a Champion juicer MILL attachment . If you want purple pastry , you can still find a better price and then compare quality . Food should be fresh regardless of who sells it to you . It should not be $ 30 with s/h . It should be roughly what you pay at a specialty grocery store , and if your local store has overpriced stock , just print out the amazon ad and take it to the manager , they will usually honor fair market value if they have something overpriced it 's often because they did not first check amazon . Amazon does beat or meet most local grocery stores even on obscure gourmet items ! I suppose it 's worth it if you want something fast , live in WA , get it without paying shipping and are going to use it for coloring baked goods naturally ... beet juice works well for that also . <br /> <br /> it might be instructive to get someone to photograph small samples of all these flours , so people do n't have to buy a box and find out they do n't have a recipe for it , or it 's stale or not what they expect , and to have little descriptions of each sample , like we do with hops , wine , cheese ... because all flours are not created equally ! the organic ones especially can be expensive ... but not this expensive . sometimes the cost of s/h is inflated because of s/h `` policy '' that might be something not just this seller can look at and scrutinize , most of my complaints -LRB- very few actually considering how much i buy and how consistently i buy -RRB- boil down to some shipping/handling problem , but s/h will only communicate with seller who hired them ... it is generally only a problem with foodstuffs , a broken machine can be photographed , repackaged and often repaired locally , food can not . there should be separate written policy for pricing packing and shipping foodstuff , some vendors do a great job , others not so much .
