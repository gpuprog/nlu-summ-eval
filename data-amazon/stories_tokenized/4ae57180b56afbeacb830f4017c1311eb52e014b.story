Let me start by saying our dogs love these . As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they 're doing and run to their crates -LRB- where we typically give these to them -RRB- . However , for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity . I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes . He does n't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it . My other dog is n't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing -LRB- this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas -RRB- . So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat . And when the eat them this quickly , they do get expensive quick .

More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy .
