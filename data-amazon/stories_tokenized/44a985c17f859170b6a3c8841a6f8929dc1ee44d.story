Cheetos ever since I was kid were one of my favorite snacks , I mean who would n't like them ? You ca n't go wrong with the original but decided to give this one a try . I 'm not a fan of unbearably hot foods but I do like things with with a kick and since this had Jalapeno in it I was assuming it was hot ... not so much . If you eat mildly hot foods this should n't bother you at all and definitely not if you like hot kind of food . I did n't even find them hot just have a unique kick of cheddery Jalapeno flavor . I would recommend to buy these at your local store if they carry them because this price on here is just insane , i buy mine for a little over 3 dollars for this bag . Overall I hope they decide to keep this one , cause they are amazing . And yes girls like these kind of snacks too :-RRB- ! Love !
