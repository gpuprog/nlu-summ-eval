We fostered a dog and bought him a bunch of toys to keep him entertained while we were at work all day . Some of the toys he loved , but this one scared him . The plastic is think and hard , so when he would roll it from side to side it made a loud noise from the impact on our hard floors . <br /> <br /> I think it would work better with carpeted homes . Also , it can be pretty tricky for dogs to get the treats out , so I would say this is an ` advanced ' toy .
