Cheez-its are ALL GREAT ! <br /> <br /> SAD how this silly American population NO longer knows how to measure ! My sympathy to you sadistics ... <br /> <br /> When I went to school ; WHEN YOU went to school , were there NOT 16 oz in a POUND ?? <br /> <br /> Cheez-its Company heicharcy did not learn their math ? They learned that there are only 13.7 in a POUND package ... they will soon forget even this measurement . . eh ?? <br /> <br /> AN AMERICAN who does not like math , but DID learn the NUMBER of ozs in a REAL POUND ! <br /> <br /> JIM of MACHIAS , PINETREE STATE !!
