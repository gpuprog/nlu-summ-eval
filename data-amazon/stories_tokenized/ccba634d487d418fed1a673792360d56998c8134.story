Awful , Awful , Awful ! I like a lighter roast and I really love french vanilla so I was thrilled to find this one . With the first sip I was highly disappointed . It has a very strong artificial flavor that does n't taste anything like french vanilla and it certainly does n't taste like coffee . Like one other reviewer said , I 'll probably just toss it in the trash and throw that money away because I do n't know anybody who would enjoy it . YUK !
