I had never tried any sort of shake n bake product before this . But i regularly bake or fry chicken with breadcrumbs , so i wanted to try this out . <br /> There was almost no difference as far as i could tell in the taste . Only difference is that shake n bake coating is somewhat more saltier . <br /> Also the breadcrumbs work well both frying and baking chicken . Shake n bake coating works if you fry as well but sometimes comes off . So for those who use breadcrumbs i would say stick -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- to them as there is virtually no taste difference and is multi-purpose .
