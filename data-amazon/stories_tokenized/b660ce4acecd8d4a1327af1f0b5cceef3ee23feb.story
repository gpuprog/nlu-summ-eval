I 've now tried various antlers for my dog from several different companies . Some were much smaller than advertised , and/or old and chalky , and some splintered severely . This antler was sized as advertized , and is holding up very well . My strong chewer is only able to slowly wear down the ends , and it does n't make a mess or splinter .
