This may sound rediculous , but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle-brand jalapeno chips . At the time I placed my order , I could n't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked , and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag . But , it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips , and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games . When I run out -LRB- probably sometime next year ! -RRB- , I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips , and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips . Imho , Kettle-brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip ` affection-ados ' . <br /> <br /> Sincerely , <br /> <br /> § homiedog §
