As I am a decaf drinker , I was amazed that this regular coffee did not upset me . Drinking this wonderful coffee is like eating chocolate covered raspberry candy . It is not bitter as some coffees are , and it does n't leave an aftertaste as some coffees do . <br /> <br /> My guests also enjoy it . <br /> <br /> All I can say is that I am very pleasantly pleased with this great tasting coffee . A great pick me up .
