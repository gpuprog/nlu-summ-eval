I purchased this soup for my husband and me due to its lower sodium content and being gluten free . We absolutely love it ! For me , it is very soothing to my stomach , and I am very pleased with the taste and the appearance of the soup both before and after adding the hot water . It is also very satisfying . After a good work out at the gym , we have this soup instead of a heavy meal .
