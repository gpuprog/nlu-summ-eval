The Zuke 's Mini Naturals is great for training and while on walks , however , this treat will dry out fast and become very hard . My mini schnauzer will refuse the treat when it is no longer moist . The treat is ok as long as the bag is kept sealed tightly . Zuke 's Mini Naturals is healthy and made in USA .
