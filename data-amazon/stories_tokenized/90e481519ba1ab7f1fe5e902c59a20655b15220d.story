This product is great . I have been searching for an easy to use and non sweetened green tea . So many of the teas are sweetened with Splenda type sweeteners and I prefer to use Stevia . The Jackie Chan green tea appears to have been discontinued . <br /> <br /> I mix this product and love the taste . A little lemon and Stevia and I have the perfect evening iced tea . It provides all the benefits of green tea , and the instant convenience . <br /> <br /> I give it five stars
