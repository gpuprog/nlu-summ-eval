I was first introduced to the Red Rice & Beans chips in my hometown of Bethlehem , PA. . When I moved to North Carolina I was unable to find these chips in my local area . On my trips back home , I would buy a bunch of bags to bring back with me to NC . Then I discovered that I could order them on-line and life was great . These chips are my all time favorite and everyone that I serve them to loves them just the same . You just got ta try them ... you 'll be hooked !!! ... . Nancy Walsh
