Finally , a great tasting fruit snack without added Sugar and/or High Fructose Corn Syrup . Clif has released something tasty that I can eat without being the equivalent of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NT69XU"> Snickers Bar </a> . It makes a great late night and on the go snack . While it 's strawberry flavored -LRB- Yes , The review is based on the strawberry flavor -RRB- , it does n't taste a thing like strawberries . It tastes as artificial <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OIT8T2"> Skittles </a> but it is n't artificial and that 's a beautiful thing . And While non-strawberry tasting strawberry flavor -LRB- At least I did n't think it tasted like strawberry -RRB- may be a minus for some people , for me , a person who does n't like the taste of real strawberry , that 's a plus . The shape of the rope is just like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UHADL4"> Red Vines </a> and if you 've had the strawberry red vines , the taste is n't that much different . And for kids , if you remove the individual wrappers and place them in a Ziploc Bag , I doubt a child would be able to tell the difference to this and a piece of licorice . I placed a few in an empty <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UHADL4"> Red Vines </a> bag , my 9 year old nephew got into them , did n't know the difference . <br /> <br /> PROS <br /> 1 . Great for kids lunches or a late night snack <br /> 2 . 70 calories <br /> 3 . No Extra sugar and/or High Fructose corn syrup or artificial sweetner <br /> 4 . Organic And All Natural <br /> 5 . 100 percent fruit with great taste <br /> <br /> CONS <br /> 1 . Not so big on the strawberry flavor . <br /> <br /> To sum it all up , If you 're looking for a nutritious snack for your kids , This is perfect
