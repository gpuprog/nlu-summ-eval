Bremner Wafers have been my favorite cracker for many years . They are the perfect accompaniment for cheese - just the right size -LRB- table water crackers are too big -RRB- , just the right crispness -LRB- Australian crisps are too brittle -RRB- , and the perfect `` background '' flavor to enhance any cheese .
