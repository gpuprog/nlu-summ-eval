I fell in love with this brand of sweet tea while on vacation , and was pleased to see that I could order it via subscribe & save through Amazon ! I find it to be less sweet than a McDonalds or Chik-Fil-A sweet tea , which I love . For me , it 's sweet , not TOO sweet , and just a clean , simple , refreshing taste . It does n't have the `` other '' tastes that some teas have -LRB- lemon , etc -RRB- . Just simple brewed sweet tea . Love it . Now I wish the big gallon bottles would become eligible for subscribe & save , too !
