Started that `` whole 30 '' diet which allows Larabars . What a treat for the palate ! Tastes like a dessert - incredibly filling and satisfying . Two and a half weeks into the diet and I 've dropped 10 pounds . I eat a Larabar every day . 100 % fruit with no added sugar or chemicals . My personal favorite is the Coconut cream pie .
