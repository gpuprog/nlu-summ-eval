Have been enjoying these noodles for years . The Thai , Korean and Vietnamese versions are but pale comparisions . Nooodles are best when water is brought to a high rolling boil , the noodles dumped in , the sauce pan covered and allowed to steep for about 1 1/2 minutes . Then pour contents into a bowl where you have already dumped in the flavor envelope . Stir , let stand for about a half minute and then enjoy without adding anything else . <br /> <br /> John Hyatt
