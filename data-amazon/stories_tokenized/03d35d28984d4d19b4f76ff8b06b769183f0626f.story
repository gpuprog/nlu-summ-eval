The belgian dark chocolate is the best hot cocoa I 've ever had so far and my 4 year daughter agrees . She pinicky about her chocolates preferring only to eat dark chocolate and this dark choco . hot cocoa sure passed the test with her . She prefers to drink it with just warm water instead of milk as using milk makes it taste like `` milk chocolate '' . I do , too !
