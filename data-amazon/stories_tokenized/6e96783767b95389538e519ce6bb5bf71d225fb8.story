I am only egg intolerant , not allergic . Adding this to my oatmeal cookie recipe today resulted in dry dough and crumby cookies . It 's barely okay . Additionally , I 'd rather do without all that soy . A better subsitute in most cases is 1 Tbsp sour cream per egg . This works especially well in pancakes/waffles and crepes ! Glad I only got a sampling of the powder instead of an expensive pound or two !
