Flavourful coconut taste and in a sturdy-package ... difficult to damage cardboard carton ... however , every two or three shipments brought a plastic top with damage or the collar where the plastic meets the cardboard separated and leaking . Amazon is wonderful about replacements , but it 's a shame the container is n't a bit more dependable . I do recommend Zico as my second best choice ... Amy and Brian being first , but talk about damaged containers !! Had to cancel my purchases from Amy and Brian due to so many cans being dented and mangled .

Zico = really good
