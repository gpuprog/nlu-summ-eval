Wellness Super5Mix is a high quality dog food . Yes , it costs more than the junk you can buy in Wal-Mart , but as with most things in life , you get what you pay for . Wellness keeps my beagle regular with no indigestion or diarrhea . I 've tried switching to cheaper brands , but they leave him gassy , listless , and constipated . My dog is n't crazy about the taste . Of course , he 'd prefer canned or , even better , table scraps . But he does eat the Wellness , and it keeps him healthy . <br /> <br /> Highly recommended !
