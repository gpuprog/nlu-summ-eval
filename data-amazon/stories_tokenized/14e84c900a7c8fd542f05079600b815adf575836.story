Friends , I love good food . This Chili Kit by Carroll Shelby is excellent . It creates an extremely savory basic chili that is easy to adjust to your particular taste in the areas of : spicy/hot , salt , or thickness . <br /> <br /> The flavor created by the spices in the main packet is the best attribute . Lots of deep , low , earthy tones that have excellent complexity and subtlety . <br /> <br /> Another great feature is the brilliant strategy of putting the cayenne pepper in a separate pouch . I only put in a little . My wife likes her chili slightly warm : warm enough to be interesting . So , I put about 1/8th of the cayenne pouch when I cook the chili , then I sprinkle extra on only my serving when I eat my bowl-full . I like a little more warmth to add to the complex flavors without so much heat that I begin to loose the ability to taste all those wonderful layers of tastes . <br /> <br /> It is another exceptionally brilliant idea to put the salt in yet another separate pouch . Again , my wife does not like very much salt at all , so I do n't put any in while cooking . I salt my bowl-full with some sea-salt , and in my opinion a little sea-salt REALLY brings out the complex flavors in this chili mix . I hope more products begin to put the salt in a separate packet . I think most folks would be appalled to see exactly how much salt is in the average meal-mix they buy : like Hamburger Helper for example . Plus for some reason good sea salt just tastes better than the cheap salt . <br /> <br /> Lastly , Mr. Shelby puts a packet of thickening powder in his kit - in addition to the main chili pack , the cayenne packet , and the salt packet . The thickening agent is simply finely ground corn meal and it does a nice job of thickening the chili if that is what you like and prefer . I have prepared this kit many times both with and without the thickening , and I like it both ways . I now just alternate for variety . <br /> <br /> PREPARATION TIPS from my personal preferences : <br /> * Saute LOTS of onion to go in the chili . At lease one large yellow onion , and I sometimes do one-and-a-half . <br /> * Always use the optional 15oz can of diced tomatoes -LRB- do n't forget to reduce the amount of water used , like the direction on the box say . <br /> * Always use the optional 15oz can of beans . My favorite are dark kidney beans , but greatly enjoy black-beans , pintos , or about any chili-style bean . TIP : drain the liquid from the can of beans into a bowl , and use the liquid as substitute for part of the `` water '' called for in the recipe . <br /> * Some favorite toppings in the bowl : sea salt , cayenne powder , diced white onions , pepper jack or cheddar cheese , black olives , guacamole , salsa , sour cream , tortilla chips . <br /> <br /> I will address some of the complaints by negative reviewers : <br /> 1 -RRB- A few said the chili was not very flavorful . Unfortunately in the USA most folks confuse `` salt '' with flavor . Since the mix has separate salt packet and none in the mix , I believe that nay-sayers have just not put in the prodigious amount of extra salt that they are used to associating with `` flavor '' . As I wrote earlier , the chili benefits from some sea salt , but for my taste , does not need large amounts . <br /> <br /> 2 -RRB- Some may say the lack of heat is not flavorful enough . Well , there are folks who like things thermo-nuclear-hot , and you just ca n't get there with the little extra cayenne packet supplied in the kit . The chili with no cayenne at all is slightly warm , and varying amounts of the cayenne powder will satisfy the tastes of 99.999 % of folks . For those who like more heat , add whatever crazy-hot stuff you require to get the heat you want . <br /> <br /> 3 -RRB- If your complaint is that it does not taste exactly like you want right out of the box -LRB- like some other brand perhaps -RRB- , I disagree strongly , because I believe that the customization offered by the different pouches included , is a greatly beneficial feature . If they made it to taste exactly like YOU want , then it probably would n't taste like many other folks want .
