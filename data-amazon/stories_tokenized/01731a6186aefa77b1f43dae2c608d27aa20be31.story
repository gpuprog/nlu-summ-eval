This stuff is hard to find but well worth the purchase . Personally I prefer the regular Frank 's RedHot , especially for the purpose of making hot wings . My wife , however , does n't like spicy foods and sauces , but she does like the Frank 's RedHot Chile 'n Lime . I think it tastes like taco sauce , and perhaps it does , but the combination of the ingredients with the lime flavoring makes this product a unique experience for the taste buds . Given that my wife absolutely loves the RedHot Chile 'n Lime , and the fact that it 's made by Frank 's , I 'm rating the sauce 5 stars .
