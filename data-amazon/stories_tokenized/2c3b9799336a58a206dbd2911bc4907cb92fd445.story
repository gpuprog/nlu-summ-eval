I bought these not realizing that they were not the regular CLIF bars ... I should have known because they are much too cheap the original ones , but I was pleasantly surprised with these ... they come in packs of two , and they are like a regular granola bar as compared to the soft/chewy consistency of the original CLIF bars . I loved these though , and the white chocolate macadamia nut was so yummy ! I would definitely buy these again ! Great value . But very messy , so definitely not recommended for a breakfast while in the car ! ha :-RRB-
