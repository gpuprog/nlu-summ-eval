While in Germany in the 80 's I bought milk similiar to this , but it had a much longer shelf life , these expire in June 2012 . I agree with many other 's who stated that the milk did not taste all that good . What really drove me to find this order was something else though , the straws are way too short . I pushed in too hard I guess & whoops in goes the straw.I will not order these again.I only went to them tonight because I was out of milk and I like drinking milk with my chilli . I guess that I will go out and buy some tomorrow when I eat the left overs . I bought the chocolate too , I hope it tastes better than the white .
