Butterscotch is another one of those flavors that I adore . Butterscotch anything is pretty much a guarantee I buy it . I love the rich buttery-ness of it . In my drinking days , butterscotch schnapps was my go-to drink . I love it . Mix it with a bit of milk or hot cocoa ... oh yes . The best , though , is around the holidays , mix a touch of it into egg nog . Ooooh , now that 's an idea , egg nog matcha . Red Leaf Tea , I will love you forever if you develop an egg nog matcha by the holidays ! I ca n't have real nog any more , so I 've been hunting for a good tea substitute . <br /> <br /> Anyway , yes . Butterscotch is love for me . It 's another Dad memory , he loves it and it makes me think of him ... or maybe I 'm just homesick this week . Butterscotch pudding is the only pudding I 'll touch and if an ice cream shop offers butterscotch topping , I 'll risk the dairy allergy to get a cone covered in the stuff . Liquid gold , it is . And seeing the success of Red leaf Tea 's Caramel and French Vanilla flavors , I have complete confidence in this blend being amazing . I think this definitely calls for a hot tea latte , despite it being stupidly hot outside . Am I in Toronto or back in Tennessee ? These hot days are killing me ... I should be able to handle them better ! <br /> <br /> No , I went for a cold matcha instead , it 's too hot out there to bother with hot drinks , though this one was made to be enjoyed hot . Hot with a touch of rum and milk . Mmm ... anyway . Yes . Cold , it 's less than stellar , but it 's still yummy . Very buttery and rich , but not too rich . I want to sip on this all day , but I need to save some for when it 's cool enough to be able to handle a hot drink . It does taste like candy , but it 's not overwhemingly sweet . It 's just tasty . I 'm not wowed by it like I am with some of their other blends , though . This one 's good , but I need to try it a few more times before I decide if I 'm going to keep it on my shelf or not . Perhaps a warmer water temperature will help , or a better ratio of tea to water . Still , it wo n't be hard at all to convince myself to drink this one ! I might even be convinced to share it .
