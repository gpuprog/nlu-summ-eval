Having lots of problems with Green Mountain cups . Coffee is fine , but plastic seems heavier than other brands and does not fully drain into cup , but drips considerably when removing to dispose . Will probably choose other brands in the future instead . Have been using K-Cups for over a year and only have had problems with this brand .
