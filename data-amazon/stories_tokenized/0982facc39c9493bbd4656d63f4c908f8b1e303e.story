Somehow , by a miracle , I found ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water and it has become my preferred drink . I have Intercystial Cyctitis , which is inflammation of the bladder , and since I started drinking ZICO , my symptoms have vanished . I absolutely LOVE the chocolate flavor ... coconut and chocolate are the BEST combination . I drink about 4 bottles a day and it keeps me feeling wonderful . I 've shopped around , and Amazon.com has the lowest price I 've found , which enables me to buy more , which is GREAT !
