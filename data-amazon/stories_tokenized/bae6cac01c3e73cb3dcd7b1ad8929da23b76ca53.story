This is , by far , the tastiest K-Cup variety I 've tried . I 've had about 10 different types , and this one is a hands-down favorite . Everyone who 's tried it at my house has loved it and been very impressed that this came from a Keurig . I think the body and richness is comparable to coffee made in a drip or -LRB- do n't shoot me , coffee purists -RRB- a press ! <br /> <br /> The flavor just barely edges toward bitter , but in a very pleasant way . It 's rich and dark and very full-bodied . A great coffee for those of us who prefer it dark -LRB- but not burnt in the Starbucks fashion -RRB- . <br /> <br /> Highly recommend this product !
