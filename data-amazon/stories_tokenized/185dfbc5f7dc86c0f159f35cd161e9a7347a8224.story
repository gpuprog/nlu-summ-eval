I enjoy the Newman 's Own Pretzels on a regular basis and decided to start buying them by the case as my local grocery store stopped carrying them . The first two cases I bought from a different distributor were fine , however in the last case I purchased from Amazon , all the pretzels tasted stale , although the bags were n't out of expiration and did n't appear to be opened . I was very disappointed with this batch .
