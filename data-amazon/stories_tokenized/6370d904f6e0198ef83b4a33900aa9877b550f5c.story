This popcorn is delicious ! I love how it tastes and that I do n't have to worry about the hulls being stuck in my teeth when I eat it ! It really is virtually hulless ! It pops quickly and easily on the stove-top by following the directions on the back of the bag ! Perfect for those who prefer an alternative to microwave popcorn or popcorn without the hull ! It 's snack-tastic !
