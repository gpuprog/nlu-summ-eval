I had been buying the same mini-bones from Amazon when they were sold under the Milkbone brand name . When I could n't find that brand anymore , I started buying the AKC brand . <br /> Since the smell of the AKC bones were different , my dogs would n't eat them . Now I dip them in milk first and they love them . <br /> I 'm glad the small bones were not discontinued since they are beefhide and are easy to chew .
