I am allergic to wheat and have tried many different brands and types of wheat free/gluten free pasta . The Tinkyada brand Rice pastas are the best I have found . The taste is very similar to standard white pasta . Rice pasta tends to have a mushy texture , even when undercooked , but when rinsed -LRB- as directed -RRB- the Tinkyada has a normal texture .
