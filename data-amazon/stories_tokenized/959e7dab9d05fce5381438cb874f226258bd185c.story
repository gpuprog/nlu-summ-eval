When it comes to weight loss , there is no such thing as one size fits all . I do n't care what the bottle looks like and I am not going to deduct points because it took an extra day or two to get to me . What really matters is 1-Does it work ? and 2-Are there any side effects ? My co-worker started taking this and based on the reviews , I figured it was another gimic . Then I tried it . I literally felt the energy burst about 15 minutes after taking it . As I left the office for the day , it dawned on me that I did not eat my normal morning or afternoon snack because I was not hungry . At lunch , I only ate half of my sandwich and -LRB- believe it or not -RRB- even turned down the brownie tray . This is huge ! I like the taste , I like the ingredients , and even after taking a shot before dinner - fell asleep at my normal time . I 'm sold and will make this a regular part of my plan . This product does exactly what it says it does - appetite suppressant .
