The flavor is strong curry with a bit of spicy hot . I decided to try the Prima Taste Rendang Curry Sauce with venison instead of beef . We primarily eat venison and elk so I felt this would be a better test for us . Following the very simple directions , I started by cutting the roast into thin strips and some chunks , nothing bigger than a silver dollar . I then stir fried the venison in oil in a steel wok until done since my wife does not care for any pink in her meat . The recipe calls for frying the meat in a pan until half done . As I finished the meat I put in the 4/5 cup of water into a pan and added the two sauce packets . One held a solid and liquid while the other a white power . -LRB- no MSG -RRB- A french whip was required to mix the white power into the water . A semi-soft material that looked like very small pieces of green corn husk were present in the sauce . I am not at all familiar with food from Singapore and have no idea what this was . My wife and I both remarked that this was the only thing we did n't like about the sauce , but it was not bad just unusual for us . When the sauce came to a boil I added the venison and let it cook as I prepared the rice and a salad . We both found the dish very tasty , my wife found it to be almost at the limit for her in `` hot '' taste . We had the leftovers the next day , I found it even more delicious . She found it hotter . We both decided that we would buy it again since it was a big change of pace for our usual venison dishes . It was very easy to make and was good with rice though I would like it with noodles as well . If you like the taste of curry this is your dish .
