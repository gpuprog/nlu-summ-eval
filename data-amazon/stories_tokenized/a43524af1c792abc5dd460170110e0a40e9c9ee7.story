Ended up purchasing three of these directly from their site . Living in Hawaii now , foraging for fresh Oregon chanterelles is a thing of the past . Though no delicious meaty chanterelles end up in any of my food . The flavor is there . Yum ^_^ <brÂ /> If your familiar with chanterelles and enjoy them . This does the trick .
