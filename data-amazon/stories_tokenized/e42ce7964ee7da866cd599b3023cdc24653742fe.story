I consider myself a `` coffee snob '' -LRB- in a good way -RRB- . I have a few gripes about this coffee , but overall , it is pretty good . When I opened the package , the espresso did n't have the good oily bean quality I wanted it to . The beans seemed a little old . Also , the quality of the crema was n't as good as Starbucks espresso or Peet 's . Again , the taste was good and these were both minor details .

Pretty good , but not the best
