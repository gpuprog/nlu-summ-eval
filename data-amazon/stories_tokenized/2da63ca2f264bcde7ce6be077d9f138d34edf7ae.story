Yes these do taste VERY slightly different from the vending machine ones but I have acquired a tasted for these over those as of late . They are nice and salty -LRB- but not overwhelmingly so -RRB- , and I love the crunch and veggie combo taste that I get . I would n't go back to the vending machine version now if they were in front me vs. the new ones . I have them almost every day now and have to hide them from the rest of the family so they 're all mine ! The sour cream flavor used to be my favorite , but now these are it . I 'm glad I gave the new packaging a try !
