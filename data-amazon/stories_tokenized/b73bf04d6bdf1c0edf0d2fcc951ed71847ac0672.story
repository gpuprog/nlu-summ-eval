My mom loved these , and would share them with me when I was a kid . These are one of my absolute favorite candy bars . They are a lot harder for me to find now locally , and Big Cherry just does n't compare . <br /> The chocolate tastes like it 's infused with the cherry flavor , it 's a milk chocolate that 's a bit above grocery store quality . Not gourmet , but not waxy and not too sweet , the nuts are just the right amount . It 's a cherry bar with nuts , not a nut bar with cherries . The nuts add a nice crunch and flavor , the creamy fondant center is cherry flavored without being too overwhelming . <br /> So much of what I thought tasted great 30 years ago does n't taste good at all as an adult . I 'm glad to say , these are still a favorite .
