I have purchased many different brands of this type of fruit . This is by far the best tasting of all I have tried . It has no `` off-putting '' bite to it . Many do ! I love it so much I can not stop making my homemade pannatone . I guess I can thank you for these 5 extra pounds !!! If you use this type of product -LRB- I am Italian -RRB- so I do , I highly encourage you to give it a try . maria domenica
