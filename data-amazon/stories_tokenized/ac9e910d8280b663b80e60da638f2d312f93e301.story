I searched out my favorite KIND bars on Amazon because I was buying them every day at the mini mart for nearly two dollars each . These are the best ; not too sweet , very filling , perfect for a post-workout craving . I signed up for Subscribe and Save to get the best deal and because I know I 'll go through these things . My first delivery came within a week but I 'm sad to say that they were stale . Not flat-out gross , thankfully they still taste good . But they are super hard and chewy -LRB- much more so than normal -RRB- and appear to have been exposed to high heat , like they melted a bit at some point . I 've got to admit that I never looked at the expiration date on one that I 've bought at a mini mart , but that 's probably because they 've never been stale or given me cause to question the freshness . As it turns out , the case I have now was delivered in September 2012 and expires in October 2013 , so they should be fine . Hopefully , this was just a fluke and the next case will be better . If not , they 're getting returned and I 'll find another source . So , the KIND Fruit & Nut bars would normally get 5 stars from me , but my experience by ordering them through Amazon brought them down a few stars . I 'll try to remember to update in the future .

A little stale ... but I 'll give them another chance
