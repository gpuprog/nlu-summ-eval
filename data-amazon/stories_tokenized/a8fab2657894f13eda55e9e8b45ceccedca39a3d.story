I like the fact that the recipe provides alternative to some of the ingredients like sugar -LRB- replace with honey -RRB- and butter -LRB- replace with canola oil -RRB- , which we did since we have moved into more consciousness in the ingredients we are consuming . The honey option definately tastes better than cane sugar -LRB- our other alternative to white and refined sugar -RRB- ; otherwise , it was not that sweet and a bit gritty . <br /> <br /> I am just pleased to have a package ready that I only need to throw in a few addtional ingredients and I have cornready within 30 minutes . The mixture made two very small loaf tins , which is enough for four-six people : nice portions .
