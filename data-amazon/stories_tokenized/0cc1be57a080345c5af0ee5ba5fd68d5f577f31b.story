We decided to buy this from Petco through Amazon instead of going to their store to get it . It was a little cheaper and it saved us a trip . To our surprise , the product is n't the same color or consistency as what we have purchased from their stores for the last few years . To make matters worse , one of our cats has suddenly developed a swollen lower lip . This can be due to an allergic reaction , and it makes us wonder if it 's a response to the obviously different product we received and fed to them . <br /> <br /> Update 5-27-10 : As noted above , the first two cases were different than what 's in the stores . Our next order was normal color and consistency . Looks like a Quality Control issue . I 'll update further about our experience .
