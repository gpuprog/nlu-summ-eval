I have two cats , one 6 and one 2 years old . Both are indoor cats in excellent health . I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it . I 've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing : Science Diet . Sure , you 'll see stories of how one person 's cat had issues , but even if that 's 100 % true , it 's 1 case out of millions . Science and fact are n't based on someone 's experience . <br /> <br /> So my point is , I love my cats and I 'm very concerned about their health . I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals . My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet . Do n't listen to me , do n't listen to the negative review . ASK YOUR VET what they recommend , and follow their instructions . My guess is you 'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow .
