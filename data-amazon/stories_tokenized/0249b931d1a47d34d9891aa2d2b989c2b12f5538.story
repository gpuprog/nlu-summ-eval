The formula is wonderful - I have n't had a single problem since I started using it when my baby was 3 months old . He 's now 9mths and is still doing great on this stuff ... I 'm just glad he 's almost near the end of his formula days since it 's the price -LRB- specifically the Amazon price -RRB- I 'm not happy with . <br /> <br /> I 've been buying this formula from Amazon since March 2012 - and at that time it was the best price out there - $ 36.70 for a 6pk -LRB- $ 6.12 / bottle -RRB- . <br /> <br /> Then by August the price had jumped to $ 38.16 -LRB- $ 6.36 / bottle -RRB- - but still the cheapest price out there , so I was n't complaining . <br /> <br /> Now - October - the price has jumped yet again to $ 41.94 -LRB- $ 6.99 / bottle -RRB- - making it more expensive than Walmart or Target . <br /> <br /> The seller has always been Amazon -LRB- not another seller through Amazon -RRB- - so it 's not a change in seller causing the price changes . I just hope the price raises were out of necessity ... and I guess I 'll have to take my $ 180 a month elsewhere from now on .
