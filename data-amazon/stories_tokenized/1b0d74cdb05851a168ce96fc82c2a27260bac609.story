Oh my word ! is all I can say about this honey ! A while back , I tried some white creamy raw honey that my sister had that was so uncomparable to any honey I had ever had . I had to have some , but when I found out how much she paid for it , $ 32 for 32 oz. , I decided to try and find something similar elsewhere . Searched all over online and this was the closest looking thing to it . Got it in the mail and found out it is exactly like the other expensive stuff I had tried ! I have truely found the most perfect honey !!! You will be so happy . Even my husband who could care less about this stuff eats it like candy . He had an upset stomach one night and I told him to eat a couple tablespoons of it , he did -LRB- well maybe more because he could n't stop munching on it -RRB- and his stomach ache went away in about a half hour . It 's just plain heavenly and consistency is just like the picture . Spreads beautifully . Please Amazon , never stop selling this !
