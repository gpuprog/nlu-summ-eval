I would personally probably give this 3 stars , but my mother and another person -LRB- both of whom LOVE Mojitos -RRB- really liked it a lot , so I thought 4 was a fairer rating . I enjoy a real Mojito now and then , but this did n't quite cut it for me . <br /> <br /> I found this to basically taste like regular Crystal Light lemonade with a little fake mint flavoring added . However , there was also a somewhat odd third taste that I could not identify ... and that 's the taste I did n't care for . <br /> <br /> That being said , with alcohol mixed in , I am certain this would probably suffice nicely , especially AFTER the first drink goes down ! ;--RRB- <br /> <br /> All in all ... I would n't buy this product again , and I almost did n't want to finish the first pitcher I made -LRB- gave the rest away -RRB- . But my Mojito-crazy loved ones liked it , so you might too ! I just did n't care for that aftertaste .

Good , but I like Appletini flavor better
