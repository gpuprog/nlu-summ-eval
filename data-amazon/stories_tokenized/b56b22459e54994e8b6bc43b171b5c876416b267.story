This is easily the best potato chip that I have ever had . Look at the ingredients : Ginger and 3 types of hot pepper . How can you go wrong ? <br /> <br /> Obviously , not for you if you do n't like spicy food . But , if you DO like spicy food , you 'll probably love these . They have that hot-with-a-hint-of-sweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of Thai food .
