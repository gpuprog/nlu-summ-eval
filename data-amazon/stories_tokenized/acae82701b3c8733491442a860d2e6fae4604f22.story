We have several cats , one of which has had a vomiting problem for many years . We tried many cats food . Science diet sensitive is one of the foods that works . There are 2 otherss . 1 is Purina 1 Sensitive which is also great . the other is a Royal Canin Oral Sensitive . I think the Science Diet and the Purina 1 are the best . We also give the cat Prednisolone under a Vet prescription , as the vet said it was inflamatory bowel disease .
