Our Maltese dog has been on wellness food for about two years now . He loves the taste - we feel good about feeding it to him because the ingredients sound ideal/healthy . He 's super healthy - has a great bathroom schedule and just overall seems like a happy well fed pup . It 's worth the price to see him feeling and looking so great . We love it !
