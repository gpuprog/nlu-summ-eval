I too , like the other reviewers am in love with agave nectar so I decided to buy it in bulk because this is a great deal ! However , when I opened my box , one bottle was only 3/4 full and the other 1/4 was spilled out all over the packaging . Unfortunately returns are n't accepted on this product and all I am left with is a sticky disappointment - mainly because I have less nectar . I do n't know if this happens on a regular basis , but I just thought I 'd give a heads up and put it out there in hope I could possibly get a reimbursement of some kind .

Love the product and service , but not the condition
