These are wonderful ! They 're definitely chocolate , but not overpowering . The sea salt provides a nice foil , so you can eat a whole bag by yourself without going into a chocolate coma -LRB- maybe that 's bad -RRB- . They 're just sweet enough to make the chocolate happen . They 're like `` hint of oreo '' without all the garbage and without all the guilt -LRB- unless you eat a whole bag in one sitting -RRB- . <brÂ /> I 've had them with a peach salsa , which was nice . I think they 'd go really well with a fresh fruit salad . They 'd go well with ice cream , and they 're perfect with a tart , plain yogurt . I dipped them in hummus too , and while it does n't not work ... I 'm not sure it 's great . Still , basically they 're versatile and not too bad for you . When you find yourself at the bottom of the bag you can always say , `` well , at least it was n't a bag of oreos . ''
