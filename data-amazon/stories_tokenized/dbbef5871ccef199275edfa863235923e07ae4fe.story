PROS _______ THIS CEREAL IS GREAT TASTING ... fills you up new box color NOT LIKE IN THE PICTURE . . yellow is a good color ... PROTIEN ... im eating it while i type this review <br /> <br /> CONS ______ small 11.5 ounce boxes ... HOW LONG WILL THAT LAST ... you dont have any ... you have to spend money on this ... when its gone you become very sad ... your always wanting more but have to wait for the next order ... <br /> <br /> 5 stars out of 5
