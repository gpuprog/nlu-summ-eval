For a company who 's name is `` Food Should Taste Good , '' they certainly do a poor job of practicing what they preach . I bought a couple bags of their lime torilla chips , and was n't the least bit impressed . Granted , I only bought them because they were so cheap , and that was only because they had been marked 75 % off -LRB- after being mark 50 % off , and 25 % off before that -RRB- . Suffice it to say , it seems that I was n't the first person to discover their horrible taste , otherwise people would have been buying them more regularly , and the Base Exchange would n't have been getting so desperate to get rid of them . <br /> <br /> Even with a gob of Tostitos cheese dip , the taste of these chips is barely tolerable .
