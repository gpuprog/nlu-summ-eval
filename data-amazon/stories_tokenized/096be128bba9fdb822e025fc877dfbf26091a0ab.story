I have a sweet tooth and so does my three year old son . This is a great after dinner dessert that I feel good about giving him and myself . They ARE healthy and you CAN taste the flax seed in them , but I have really grown to love that healthy taste and texture . I even come to crave it now . They are satisfying and filling and my whole family loves them . I buy them in bulk and love other Hodgson Mill products as well . <br /> <br /> If you eat nothing but white flour products and ca n't get used to or absolutly hate whole grains and their taste and texture , then this is not the product for you . If you are the family that tries to make healthy choices and have healthier alternitives then this is a wonderful product . I still love to have my junk food -LRB- Pillsbury and Hershey 's here I come !!! -RRB- I just try to have it only on very special occasions . The rest of the time I choose to nurish my body and satisfy my taste buds . That is when I reach for this brownie mix . <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that they do n't taste too great after only a couple days . So make up a batch , eat em ' up quick -LRB- within 2 days -RRB- and you will be smiling !
