according to the dietician at our vet 's office this food has several elements at too high levels for cats . the most problematic being ash . our cat suffered from uninary tract problems soon after we switched to this and had to spend 2 days in the vet 's office at a substantial cost . might be a good product but for our 14 yr old , it was not a good balance of ingredients .
