I recently upgraded to higher quality canned food , first trying the standard Weruva offerings and now the BFF -LRB- a Weruva sub-brand ? -RRB- I like that BFF offers flavors with gravies and others with aspic , as it increases feeding time variety . BFF is certainly a good value compared to the other high-end natural and grain-free products , and even my pickiest senior guy enjoyed the tuna and bonito variety . I will continue purchasing the standard Weruva in Paw Lickin ' Chicken since my boys love it , but we are happy to mix it up with BFF . The inclusion of the skin on some fish pieces is certainly a confidence-booster that my cats are getting real food , not mystery meat . I also appreciate the 5.5 ounce can size , as we can share a can each feeding and both cats get their fill .
