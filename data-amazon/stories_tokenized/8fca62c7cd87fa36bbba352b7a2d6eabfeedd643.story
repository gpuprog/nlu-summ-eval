I bought this product based on the reviews and price . However nowhere in the product description or reviews does it tell you how much your getting . I assumed for $ 14.95 + $ 6.76 Shipping -LRB- $ 21.71 total -RRB- that I was getting a gallon . Imagine my surprise when I found it was in my mail box . After I opened the box , I discovered that it was only 1 pint -LRB- 16oz -RRB- . This wo n't last a week around my family . It can make the best tasting popcorn in the world and it still will not be worth it ! Take my advise and buy the gallon size at http://www.amazon.com/Paragon-Coconut-Popcorn-Popping-Gallon/dp/B002YLI9E2/ref=pd_cp_ba_1_im <brÂ /> It is only $ 6 more . SO DO N'T WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS RIP-OFF !
