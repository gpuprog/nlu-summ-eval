Senseo pods are very convenient and reasonably priced -- I only wish the brew was a little more `` tasty '' . Since I do n't like dark-roast beans/coffee , I ordered the `` medium roast '' . Much to my surprise , it is TOO mild for me ! This is particularly so since a pod really is only intended to make an 8 oz . cup of coffee . My coffee maker allows me to use up to 12 oz . of water and then it 's really way too mild/weak . <br /> <br /> The Senseo pods are ordered by the case , so it 's going to take me a long time before I can try a stronger brew . My recommendation is to be sure and try all the flavor options before ordering a full case of pods .
