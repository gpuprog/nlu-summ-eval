OMG were these excellent . You have to toast the rolls like the directions say . Make sure you combine the lobster with the ingredients at the bottom of the container . Eat like there 's no tomorrow . And when you get to the bottom of the box , dessert awaits . 6 Whoopie Pies . Not whoopie pies but WHOOPIE PIES . OMG I was full . I 'm sure I read somewhere this box is a meal for one , right ? That 's what I 'm telling the family , at least .

Leave them for me - I 'll suffer for you and devour these
