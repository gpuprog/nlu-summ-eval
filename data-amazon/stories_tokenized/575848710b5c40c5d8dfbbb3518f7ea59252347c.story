Because of the price , I decided to only feed this to my oldest -LRB- and only overweight -RRB- dog -LRB- out of 3 dogs -RRB- . She looks so good and still has a lot of youth and energy . I adopted all of them , but I believe she is about 11 . I have n't weighed her , but she has visibly lost weight after 2/3 of the bag ! I 'm guessing she has gone from 90 to 85 pounds in about 3 weeks , which is incredible . I read a lot of good things online about the ingredients of this and a few other premium foods . We will certainly continue with this if we can afford it ; it 's actually a great value if you have Prime ; which is worth it if you 're going to be ordering heavy items such as this .
