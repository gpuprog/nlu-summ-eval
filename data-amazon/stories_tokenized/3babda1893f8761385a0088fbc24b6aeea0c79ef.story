This tea was surprisingly hard to find at the health food store , so I bought it online . Reading about possible ways to off-set liver damage 2/2 medications -LRB- statins in particular -RRB- , I figured , why not -- I drink tea , so I can try this one . It tastes ok . Not great . But drinkable . <brÂ /> I think this tea is a fair alternative to taking another pill .
