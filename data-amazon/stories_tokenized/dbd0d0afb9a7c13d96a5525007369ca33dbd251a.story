I purchased 4 bags of weight management food for four very lazy , old and fat cats ... and i put 1/2 cup of each food in a bowl and left it out for a couple of hours ... this was the food they all devoured first . It 's not scientific , but everyone likes it and when we have to use one of the other foods -LRB- ie empty cupboard -RRB- they complain !
