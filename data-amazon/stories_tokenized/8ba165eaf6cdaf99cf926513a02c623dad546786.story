These are one of the few treats my dog loves that are not bad for him . It 's like semi-healthy junk food for dogs . Alot of the other treats you have to be careful about . Some are made in China from sawdust and flavored with beef and chicken broth . Beware of ANYTHING mande in China . ANYTHING !!! Do your homework before buying treats and other things for your pets !!!
