I eat very little candy , but every once in a while I ca n't resist . Well , sometimes I 'll try a candy substitute and on my last trip to the grocery store , I spotted some bags -LRB- 2.75 ounces -RRB- of Werther 's Original Hard Candies -LRB- Sugar Free -RRB- . They 're very low in calories . Okay , are they any good ? Well , they taste a little like a very weak creamy caramel hard candy . I tired of them after the third one . They have a bit of an illusion of candy , but just do n't match up . I doubt that I 'll finish the bag . Oh well , maybe it 's for the best . <br /> <br /> Gary Peterson
