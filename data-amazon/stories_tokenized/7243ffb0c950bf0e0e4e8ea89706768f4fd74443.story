I know that the product is good but your ad says `` 30sachets at 20grams each equals 300 grams '' . Well , 30 times 20 equals 600 not 300 . So what do you get for the advertised price , 600 grams or only half as much ? I asked this question two times last week , once by email and once by phone , yet I still have not received a response and I see no correction on the website . I want to buy , I just need to know what I am getting .
