I could n't believe how much this Crystal Light Mocktail tasted like the real deal . My wife and I are BIG fans of Margaritas , Mojitos , and the like , but are not always fans of the calories that come with them . Along comes Crystal Light to the rescue with their Mocktails - yes , calorie-free imitation cocktails that even the kids could drink . They truly do taste good ... though no not quite an exact replica of the real drink . For the purpose it 's designed to do ... these drinks serve the task well . Highly recommended !
