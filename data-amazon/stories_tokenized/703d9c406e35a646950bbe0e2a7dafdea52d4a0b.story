I 've done my fair share of research on dog food . I went from the Wellness Super5Mix , which was a good dog food but gave my dog some bad gas and still had fillers in it . Then I thought I was crazy for spending so much money on dog food , so I went to Beneful , which eliminated the bad gas but I felt bad feeding such garbage to my dog on a daily basis . So I found this one and I have n't looked back ! Granted my dog will eat anything , but his coat looks brighter , shinier , and his poop does n't even really smell , which I find unusual -LRB- Ca n't complain with that though -RRB- . <br /> <br /> Cheapest to buy on Amazon , especially with Free Shipping . <br /> <br /> A must have purchase for me !
