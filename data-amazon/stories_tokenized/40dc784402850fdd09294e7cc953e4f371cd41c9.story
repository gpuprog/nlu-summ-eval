This is an excellent wild rice . Wild rice can be hard to find in the grocery stores , especially in the South . I happen to love it , and most of all , I love the price here rather than buying a tiny stale box in a grocery store . It 's reasonably fresh , the grains are reasonably whole , and I 'm reasonably pleased too ! <br /> <br /> Some reviewers have complained about some broken grains . I feel that is probably inevitable after shipping , and since I live a long ways from the wild rice fields , I 'm going to have to accept the broken grains as part of the deal . There are n't many , it 's very much whole grain and `` fancy '' grade . I 'd serve this to guests or my family without worries . <br /> <br /> We do n't generally mix wild rice while cooking , preferring to mix other rices in after cooking them separately so that I do n't have to worry about different ratios of cooking time , water , etc. . Typically , I use wild rice in a wild rice pilaf or stuffing for poultry . I definitely recommend this brand .
