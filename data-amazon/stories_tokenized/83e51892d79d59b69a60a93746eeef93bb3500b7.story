Any microwave popcorn claiming to be low fat/calorie does not compare to this Smart Balance brand . This one has the lowest calories . Does it taste like movie theatre butter popcorn ? Well , no , but it is still good , and you get used to skipping all that butter . I call it guilt-free microwave popcorn .
