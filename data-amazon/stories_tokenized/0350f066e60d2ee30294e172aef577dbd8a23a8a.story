Maybe it 's just me , but I do n't really like this seasoning all that much . It 's not that it tastes bad , but for Fajita Seasoning I 'd expect it to have more kick . I find myself reaching for the Taco Seasoning we bought from them instead , and adding some chili powder or black pepper as well .

It 's alright ... I definitely prefer their Taco Seasoning
