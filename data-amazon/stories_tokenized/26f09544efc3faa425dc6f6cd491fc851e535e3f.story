I also reviewed the Jones Soda Berry Pomegranate vitamin water and that one fell short because it was mostly water and sugar and cost over $ 1 per bottle . <br /> <br /> The Switch Orange Tangerine is much better in my opinion in terms of flavor . It 's also carbonated up quite a bit and has added ascorbic acid -LRB- Vitamin C -RRB- which gives it a lot of tang/bite . For me it is n't unpleasant at all - I like it . <br /> <br /> Contrary to other reviews , I do n't get the medicine aftertaste . It 's just a good , refreshing , carbonated drink . I tried this after getting in from a fairly warm bike ride and it does a pretty good job of quenching thirst . I tried it straight from a room temperature can and over ice and both were great . I like it over ice better , though . Then , just for fun , I added some Malibu rum to see how it was as a mixer and it 's not bad . I wo n't be asking for it at a bar , but it gets the fruity flavor with the coconut rum and I think if someone was creative , this could be a match made in heaven . <br /> <br /> The down side -LRB- to me -RRB- is this is another fairly pricey drink . The cans are n't full-size cans either . So for almost $ 1 per can you get a smallish 8.3 ounces but with regular sodas you get 12 ounces - half again as much . Of course , sodas are n't 100 % juice either . <br /> <br /> Upshot is if I 'm on a beach somewhere and hot and thirsty , I 'd probably buy this . For stocking at home , I 'll stick with regular frozen orange juice or orange juice in a carton . I would recommend trying it for yourself , though . This seems to be one of those drinks that could sway pretty hard depending on personal preferences .
