Ordered this popcorn after wondering what type of popcorn was used for the gourmet places like `` nuts on clark '' and other stands used . The popcorn did n't dissapoint . Very large kernels , great for not only eating `` straight up '' , but also with a lot of nice surface area for coatings like caramel . Popped in a `` movie theatre '' style popcorn machine at my office with the solid coconut oil popcorn oil and some salt , and it 's like something straight out of the stores . <brÂ /> Kernels are not quite as tender as smaller popcorn , but it is certainly not `` tough '' , especially when coated with a caramel crunch .

Just like the gourmet popcorn stands
