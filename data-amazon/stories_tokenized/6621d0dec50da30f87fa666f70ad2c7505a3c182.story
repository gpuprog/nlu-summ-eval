I * really * wanted to like this coffee , because it sounded great on paper , and had a slew of good reviews . However , my taste buds say different : this coffee 's burnt . It 's dark , oily , and bitter . On top of that , it also tastes extremely weak , no matter how high of a coffee to water ratio is used . You would hands down get a better cup using Starbucks from the grocery store -LRB- a better value for your money -RRB- . The only redeeming quality I can see so far is the product packaging -LRB- +1 star -RRB- , which is very attractive and lively . Verdict on Magnum Jamaican Blue Mountain Blend : ugh , do n't bother . This stuff tastes like crap . <br /> <br /> My usual brews : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5PB0"> Jeremiah 's Pick Coffee Colombia Supremo Decaf Whole Bean Coffee , 10-Ounce Bags -LRB- Pack of 3 -RRB- </a> or Peet 's
