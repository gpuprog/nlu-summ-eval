I love coconut water because it brings back memories of when I was a little kid and my grandmother in Miami would cut a coconut in half and let me sip the amazing water , which is often slightly surgary/salty . The problem : most canned coconut waters are nothing like it . Now there IS a coconut water . O.N.E. 's 11 ounce coconut waters is NUMBER ONE . It 's not just refreshing , but it 's exactly like the original coconut water I remembered with the wonderful taste , smoothness and ability to quench your thirst . Also , it 's totally natural , with five electrolytes and more potassium than a banana !
