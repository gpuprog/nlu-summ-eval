The packaging is really the deal here . It 's really glorified applesauce , but it 's organic , convenient , and tasty . My boys , 4 and 2yrs , love them . Grape might be their favorite flavor , but they eat them all . It is perfect for snacks in the car , traveling , or lunches , because it does n't require refrigeration , is almost mess free , and is resealable . They unscrew the cap and suck it out then reseal it , no messy cups of applesauce floating around the car or inside their lunch bags . I love it !
