It taste great for the first 2-3 spoonfuls then it all turns into a red-ish mush with strawberries here and there . I 'm one of those people that hates soggy cereal and do my best to stay away from the flaked stuff because it always gets soggy fast . I 'm surprised this got so soggy after just pouring the milk in . Taste wise I 'd give it 5/5 first 3 spoonfuls where great ! cereal wise I give it a 1/5 it does n't hold up well in milk and I think that 's one of the key points of being a great cereal . Overall 3/5 they need to work on making this stuff less soggy . <br /> <br /> and to those that disagree enjoy your mushy cereal ! <br /> User Tip : Pour your milk first then the cereal on . It stays crunchy longer .
