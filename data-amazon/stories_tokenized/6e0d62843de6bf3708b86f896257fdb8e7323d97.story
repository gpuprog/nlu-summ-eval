When I received this container of Paprika , the expire by date was already up . I spoke with a representative of the company and his words were `` even if the date is expired the product is still good . Just store it in the fridge to keep it fresh '' . That is unacceptable . I specifically purchased this item with the intention that it would be fresh and it was not . Would not buy this brand again .
