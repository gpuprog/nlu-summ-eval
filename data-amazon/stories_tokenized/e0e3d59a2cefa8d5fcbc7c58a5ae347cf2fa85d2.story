recently tried the choc raspberry k cups . I am not fond of the flavor . It smells delish , but , definately not enough chocolate flavor for me . I find that by combining a hot chocolate k cup , along with a bold coffee , I get the desired flavor that I enjoy . For someone who enjoys a hint of flavor , the VH chocolate raspberry truffle k cups would be excellent . Thank you .
