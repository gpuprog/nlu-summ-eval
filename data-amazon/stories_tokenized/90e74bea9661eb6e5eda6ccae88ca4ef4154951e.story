I was a bit worried about ordering a bouquet from Falcon Farms , because I had read so many bad reviews . But I have to say that the flowers arrived exactly when I wanted them to arrive -LRB- two days after placing the order -RRB- , they were hand delivered and I was told that they were in perfectly good condition and looked beautiful . The only thing I do n't know at this point is how long they will last . I would definitely use Facon Farms again .
