I think Chebe products in general are awesome . The focaccia bread is great for a flat bread pizza . We have even used it for burgers and sandwiches . It 's not the same as real bread of course , but it 's a great alternative that everyone -LRB- including friends who are not gluten free -RRB- likes .
