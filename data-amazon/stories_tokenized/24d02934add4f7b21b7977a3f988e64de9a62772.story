When I found out about this product from Jorge Cruise 's site , I could n't wait to try it . It took many visits to specialty stores -LRB- names obtained from the Zevia website -RRB- before I finally found one that had just two cans of the Ginger Root Beer in stock . I bought both cans , even though I never really drink root beer . After tasting Zevia Ginger Root Beer , I love root beer now ! This is my favorite flavor , even over Cola and Orange -LRB- have n't had the Twist , yet -RRB- . <br /> <br /> Everything in the Ginger Root Beer is natural , and there 's no caffeine -LRB- like the Cola , even though it 's supposed to be natural caffeine -RRB- . The cola is my next favorite that I have occasionally . I did not care much for the orange , it tasted artificial and not very orangy-tasting . I highly recommend the root beer flavor , though .
