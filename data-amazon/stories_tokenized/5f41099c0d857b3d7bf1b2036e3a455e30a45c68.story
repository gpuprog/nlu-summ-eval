This is fabulous . Heard about it on Sean Hannity and wanted to try it . My wife bought it for me as an early Christmas present . The set up and operation is super simple . To me the taste is excellent because it is so fresh . I like Polar sodas and those work out to about $ .98 a liter . This does $ .67 a liter . The diet cola does not have the classic metal taste and no aspartame . If you love diet soda you will love this . If you do n't , you will leave a poor review . I thought it would taste like a cheap store brand diet cola , and it is so much better than that . It reminded me of Coke Classic .
