Okay , Okay , I can see your eyes rolling . Instant mashed potatoes ? Well , not everyone has the luxury of having the time -LRB- or skill believe it or not -RRB- to properly prepare mashed potatoes . There are many things that are going on in our lives and having to make a side dish that takes more time and/or effort to prepare than your main course on a weekday evening just ai n't gon na cut it . The nasty instant -LRB- dehydrated -RRB- potato ? , blasphemy you say ! <br /> <br /> Well , I may not be totally crazy -LRB- although the jury is still is still out on this one -RRB- but there is at least one -LRB- the only one that I know of -RRB- that is pretty damn good and it is the Idahoan REAL Premium Mashed Potatoes that I used to buy at Costco long ago in 3.24 lbs containers . For what ever reason , Costco stopped carrying this product but may still may carry some of the Idahoan potato product line . <br /> <br /> In short , they taste pretty darn good by themselves but I have been known to add in some sour cream in lieu of some of the milk , blend in some well-cooked cauliflower , cheese or even some bacon bits . Just follow the directions . It is that easy . Also , instant mashed potatoes can also make a good gravy thickener if used in small quantities . <br /> <br /> I just ordered some from Amazon.com for $ 14.337 a box . Remember , this box weighs more than 3 pounds and will last a long time and price per ounce you ca n't beat ... and as a matter of fact , you ca n't even mash it . lol <br /> <br /> I usually order more to get the Super Saver shipping discount .
