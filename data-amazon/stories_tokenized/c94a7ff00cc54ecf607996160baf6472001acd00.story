Many positive reviews are a testament to the quality of this product . This product is voluntarily labeled as being produced with Non GMO -LRB- Genetically Modified Organism -RRB- ingredients . It is nutritious , as based on the health chart , but also has a good taste along with an appealing aroma . I trust the Lundberg family 's commitment to quality and have purchased their products for the last few years .
