It 's a bit pricey with shipping , but I bought this because this brand has unusual colors . I needed purple for a King Cake , and here in Illinois you just ca n't find purple sugar . I actually like this brand quite a bit , and would recommend it . <br /> <br /> The colors are nice and bright compared to some cheaper brands I 've seen . The first thing I noticed , however , is that the sugar crystals are LARGE compared to the near-shavings I get from the colored sugars I got at the local grocery store . I guess I 'll have to go buy the Green and Gold ones too , so they match next time .
