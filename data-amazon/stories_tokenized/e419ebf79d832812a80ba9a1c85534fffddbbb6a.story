When we got our dog , Sydney 3 years ago ... I could not find a single thing that she would chew on that would last more than 10 minutes . <br /> <br /> I tried everything , until I found this ! It 's definitely her favorite and every once in a while , I toss it in the dishwasher with her Kong and bowls to keep everything fresh . I just bought another one for the first time because she 's finally chewed through both sides . <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this to anyone who only wants to buy a chew toy every few years .
