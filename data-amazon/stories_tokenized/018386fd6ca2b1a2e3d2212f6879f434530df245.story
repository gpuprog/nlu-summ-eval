This is a great way to stop wasting money on creamer . We use creamer in cocoa and it 's always been an issue for kids on how much to use . With these little cups , that do n't need to refrigerated , we have cut back on over creaming cocoa and wasting of creamer . The creamer comes in one big box ; I was expecting a box within the box . I would recommend keeping a supply in the frige to help cook the cocoa when making it .
