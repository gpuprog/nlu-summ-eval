The quality of Marshalls Creeks Marjoram is less than ideal though it is not horrible . The `` sealed '' container is not really `` sealed at all '' I had spider webs and mold -LRB- somehow -RRB- in some other herbs I purchased from them . Of the herbs purchased the Marjoram and Chives were essentially the only usable herbs . Purchase at your own risk
