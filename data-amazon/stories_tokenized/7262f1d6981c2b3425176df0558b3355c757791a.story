This product was recommended by my dental hygienist . It looks and tastes just like cane sugar but has fewer calories and does not digest the same as sugar so is low glycemic . It also helps repel bacteria in the mouth . This product has been around in Europe for 100 years and why we do n't use it more in the USA is a mystery . I 'm diabetic and this product does not raise blood sugar . It 's amazing to have something to replace sugar in my coffee ! Ask your dentist about this product . I also love that it 's make of American hard wood which is a renewable resource . Do not by xylitol from China !
