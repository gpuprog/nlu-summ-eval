This cereal tastes good with or without milk , holds up well -LRB- keeps its crunch -RRB- with milk . The cinnamon flavor is not overpowering and it is n't too sweet . This cereal is pretty much like shredded wheat but made with oats . What the differences are nutritionally between shredded what and this cereal is , perhaps would make a difference as to which you would prefer . <br /> <br /> It is good , but is it really anything new ? 4 starts for taste and crunch .

Not bad but is it necessary ?
