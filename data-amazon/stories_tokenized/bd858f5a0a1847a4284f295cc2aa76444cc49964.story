I feel like I was tricked a little -- hence the 4 stars rather than 5 . The picture implies that you would receive a half-gallon size , whereas when you read , you see that it says 6-32oz . cartons -LRB- Quart size -RRB- . I did n't read when I ordered , I was in a rush , and after receiving my package , quite timely I might add , I was a little confused . I had to go back and look at it , and read !! So , the picture does NOT match the product you will receive , just be aware !! Otherwise , it 's just as perfect a product as you could ask for .
