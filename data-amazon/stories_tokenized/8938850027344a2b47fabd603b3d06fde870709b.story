I received a Keurig machine for Christmas and was eager to sample all of the coffees that were included . Unfortunately the Caribou Blend was absent in my sampler . Lucky for me I decided to pick up a box of this coffee once the sampler was depleted . I can sum up my experience with one word ... `` WOW ! '' This coffee is very smooth but loaded with flavor , even on the largest cup setting . I was taken aback when I took my first sip ; the subtle hint of berry and chocolate was so pleasant . I would say this is one of the best , if not THE best , coffees I 've ever tasted .
