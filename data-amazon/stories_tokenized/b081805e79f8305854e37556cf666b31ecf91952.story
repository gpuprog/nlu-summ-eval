This rosehip tea is surprisingly good , reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone . The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it 's a good job it was n't ordered as a gift . I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags . I just could n't find this flavor in supermarkets , so I had to get it online .
