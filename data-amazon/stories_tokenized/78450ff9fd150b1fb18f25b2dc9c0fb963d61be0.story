If you like smoked sea salts this is a very good product . The smoke flavor is mild and the taste is great . I put this salt in a grinder and find that the crystals are a bit small so it comes out fast . I may switch to a small jar and salt spoon or a large holed shaker . The 12.4 oz jar is enough to go a long way as seasoning salt .
