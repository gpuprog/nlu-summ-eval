This Planter 's Triple Nut Chewy Granola Bar was quite good ! It was a nice blend of different nuts : honey roasted peanuts , almonds & cashews : it was both crunchy & chewy , with a touch of crisp ... it was not overly sweet , but was sweet enough for my tastebuds ! With 220 calories , 12g fat , 23g carbs , 13g sugars and only 230mg of sodium , this is a good snack bar , for when you need to delay a meal for awhile ~ It made me crave another , and I would definitely buy this product to have it again : it 'd be great as a snack in between meals , to carry in your purse , etc. <br /> <br /> All in all , I would definitely recommend this Planters BIG Nut Bar !
