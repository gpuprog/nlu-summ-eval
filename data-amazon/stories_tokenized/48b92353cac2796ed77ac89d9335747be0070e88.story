I was looking for something less bland than Caffix . Well , this is less bland , but the flavor and aroma are hard to describe . Maybe like someone stirred it with a crayon ? Also a raw flour taste ? Something was n't right ... <br /> Also , the powder did n't dissolve as completely as Caffix 's crystals . I had a lot of foam on top . <br /> One cup was enough - I 'll go back to Caffix . <br /> I like Caffix better if I mix instant decaf with it . A ratio of 2/3 Caffix to 1/3 instant decaf . Much better .

It has a taste and smell that I do n't care for
