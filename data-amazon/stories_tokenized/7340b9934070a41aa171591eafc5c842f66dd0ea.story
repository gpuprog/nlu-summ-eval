Coffee has gone sky high . While this coffee is not fresh roasted when you order and then shipped-it comes pretty close because the flavor is so good . <br /> My favorite coffee is now well over $ 57 a 5 lb bag , so I decided to try this and it was great-I like a low acid but very robust , dark cup of <br /> coffee and this fits the bill . What can I say-the price is right too

High coffee prices make this coffee the tops
