I really liked these gnocchi , they were delicious Though it 's true what the other reviews said about not a strong sweet potato flavor . So I microwaved a sweet potato and addded it to the gnocchi . It made a nice meal . I gave a couple of packages to friends and they liked the taste as well . You just have to not overcook . I bought the Gia Russo whole wheat spaghetti and liked that as well . I am now going to order Gia Russo mini gnocchi .
