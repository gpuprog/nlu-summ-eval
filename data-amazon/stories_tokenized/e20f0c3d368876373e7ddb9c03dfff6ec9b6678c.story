I wish Amazon would require any coffee with sweet artificial flavorings to be plainly identified as such . Then folks who really dislike coffee adulterated this way could avoid getting another disappointing flavored cup of coffee . This stuff tastes the way I imagine Newman 's Own Extra Bold coffee would taste with curdled , spoiled Bailey 's Irish Cream dumped in it - nasty . Shudder !!!

Not Jamaican at all , just another sweet , flavored coffee !
