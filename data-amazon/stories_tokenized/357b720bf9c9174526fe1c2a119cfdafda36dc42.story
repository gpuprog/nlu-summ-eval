I like Hatch 's Tex-Mex style enchilada sauce , but these were obviously damaged during manufacturing and packed in a flat for commercial use . All 12 of the cans showed some dents , but the dents were on the inner sides , so the damage was done before shrink-wrapping , not during Amazon 's shipping . I will use them , but do n't think Amazon should be getting `` seconds '' for sale .
