Salty and rank with an inedible flavor and a mushy , slimy texture . I could n't even finish the first can and I had 23 more to do . My cat took a few sniffs of it and then walked away . If he wo n't eat it knowing how my cat loves tuna , I wo n't either . It 's not even pure tuna in water . It contains vegetable broth with soy on top of the salt that 's in there . This little can has 350 mg . of sodium . Truly disgusting . <br /> <br /> There 's another good review of the same tuna which is the one I saw . Had I seen these I would n't have bought this . I 'm going to post this on the other page too .
