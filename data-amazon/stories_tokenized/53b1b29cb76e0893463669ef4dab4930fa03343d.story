The problem with this Angel Hair Pasta is the texture of the cooked product . I boiled my first box cooking it on the low side of the recommended time on the box and the pasta still came out somewhat gummy . I ate half and saved the other half for the next day . It was still gummy the next day but I managed to eat it anyway . I will continue to experiment with times and see if I can improve on it , but unless I crack this nut , I wo n't be ordering it again .

Not the greatest product ...
