This is exactly the product I 've been looking for . Individually wrapped spices that will stay fresh longer , are easy to use because they are pre-measured , are organic and most of all , useful for cooking what I cook . <br /> This is such a great idea ! I have lots of spices -LRB- too many , really -RRB- but I can see that they sit on the shelf for years and get stale . They are so expensive to begin with , what a shame ! <br /> Do what I did : put a little sticker on each spice in your spice cabinet and label it with this year -LRB- 2009 -RRB- . Then forget about it . The next time you have to use a spice , use it , but someday , when you are cooking something special and want to have the spices be of the best quality , look at the date on that spice - you 'll be amazed how old it is !
