I need to drink decaf in the morning and use a larger travel mug for my early cups of coffee . While regular decafs dilute on the Keurig 12oz setting , I find the Emeril 's decaf stays strong . While I am concerned about the recent jump in K-Cup prices and Green Mountain 's new monopoly , I ca n't take that out on the review of the taste of this product .

Strong enough for 12oz + cups
