I was a little disappointed to find that the amount of spice is actually quite small . I find it difficult to figure out size and weighting with spices on line because some of it can depend on packaging . But with the cut of the spices , you really only get about 1.5 T of spices . Flavors and blend are otherwise good though I was further disappointed to find that this blend lacks Chervil - something I did n't notice before ordering . Had I seen that , I would have ordered a different mix from another company .

Smaller than expected and minus Chervil
