Shiritaki noodles have no carbs , no calories and no taste . Fact of life . They , however , make a nice addition to any sauce that you care to put them under to add bulk to your meal and substitute for high carb and calorie pasta . <brÂ /> Read the directions and prepare accordingly by boiling , then carefully draining or drying in a hot skillet . The pasta will then absorb some flavor and no dilute the sauce .
