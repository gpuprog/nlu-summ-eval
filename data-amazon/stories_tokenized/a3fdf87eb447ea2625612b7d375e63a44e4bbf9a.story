I tasted these chips at Costco and it was love at first bite . Being a hummus lover I thought it quite clever that someone had thought to make a chip out of it !! I now understand the customer reviews that warn of hummus chip addiction ! My friends really like them , too . <brÂ /> I can no longer find them at Costco or any of my grocery stores which is unfortunate as I feel these chips would sell really well . Thank goodness for Amazon .
