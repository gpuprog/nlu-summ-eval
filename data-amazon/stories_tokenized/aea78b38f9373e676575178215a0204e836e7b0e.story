The title above refers not only to a semi-obscure Damon Runyan-based movie with Bob Hope -LRB- we ALL knew that -RRB- , but to these classic lemon drops with a truly international pedigree : <br /> <br /> Made in Spain ; owned by the French -LRB- Cadbury France , located at 143 Boulevard Romain Rolland , Paris ; imported by New Jersey 's own `` Euro-American Brands , '' Paramus , NJ 07652 . <br /> <br /> All the way from Paris to your local candy seller or movie theater -LRB- which is where I experieced my first taste of La Vie en Lemon -RRB- . They were everything a lemon drop should be : A sugary entrance , developing into a deeply satisfying , soul-stirring essence of pure lemon . The mouth-watering joy of the lemon drop is seductive and addictive , and I am nearly certain that sucking on these golden gems made Kurosawa 's `` Savage Dogs '' even more enjoyable . <br /> <br /> They 're hard candies . but not so hard that you could n't cheat and bite into one , breaking it up into ten or so smaller candies , zig-zagging around your mouth like offshoots from a single magnificent fireworks explosion . <br /> <br /> One 2-ounce tin lasted longer than the 2 hours or so of Kurosawa 's brilliant detective drama , one of his first with Toshiro Mifune , who once again delivers a compelling performance . Although the packaging is a bit precious , there 's nothing pretentious about the taste of Les Citrons , and as for value , these drops are the working man or woman 's workhorse . They 're far less expensive than other candy -LRB- to say nothing of popcorn -RRB- , and their staying power is extraordinary . <br /> <br /> Still , this vendor charges more than some others , and with the added shipping fee one may wish to purchase these at a local outlet -LRB- or occupying it until your lemon drop demands are met -RRB- . If you 're serious about your lemon drops , tt 's Paris 1968 all over again . <br /> <br /> Nutritional Information per Package -LRB- 30 pieces ; you could try to eat the suggested serving size of 3 drops , but I find this highly unlikely -RRB- . 240 calories , no fat or sodium , 60 grams carbohydrates , 60 grams of sugar , no protein , and no trace of food allerges . Sugar , corn syrup , citric acid , natural flavor , and tumoric for color . THh lemon-decorated little tin adds a touch of Europe to any room , and is ideal for holding cuff links , tickets , keys , small , delicate make-up products , or quarters for the laundry . To paraphrase the great Margaret Dumont : <br /> `` Les Citrons , Toujours ... Les Citrons ! ''
