Natural , butter-free microwave popcorn is becoming very hard to find . Thank goodness Newman 's Own follows its usual high quality with this product . The bag pops almost completely and the contents tastes just like popcorn , not like the greasy artificial quasi-butter-like-substance most microwave popcorns taste like . If you want butter , melt some real stuff and put it on yourself . But personally , this stuff does n't need it .
