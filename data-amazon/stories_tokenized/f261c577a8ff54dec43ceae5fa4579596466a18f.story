Like too many GF products these are drowning in salt to drown out the bland rice flour flavor . I discovered Glutino crackers over the holidays and recommend them as the best gluten free cracker I 've tried . My favorite is the Glutino Cheese Cracker with just a hint of cheese flavor that compliments rather than overwhelms the flavor of the spreads , cheese etc. spread on top . A great find for holiday !
