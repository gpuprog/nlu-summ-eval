I have always LOVED this and all of a sudden I made it last night and both my son and I had an after taste of rubbing alcohol when we ate it . I am not sure if it is the new ranch seasoning -LRB- because they have changed it from when we used to get it back in the 90 's -RRB- or what the deal is . I was just wondering if anyone else noticed this ?
