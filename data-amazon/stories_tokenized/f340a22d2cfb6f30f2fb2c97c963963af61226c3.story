I bought this to compliment my growing Stash Tea collection at the office . Like my friends they expected a sharp lemon taste with this tea however upon trying it you notice the ginger seems to have the stronger taste . I like the tea though - it is a strong tea -LRB- former black coffee drinker here -RRB- if you let it sit for awhile . Definitely recommend .
