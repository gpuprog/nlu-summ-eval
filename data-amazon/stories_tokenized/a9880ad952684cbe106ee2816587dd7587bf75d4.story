I made with 6 ounce of hot water to start and it was a little too sweet for me so added 2 more ounces of cold to cool and make an 8 ounce cup . The drink is a brown color . It says honey but it tastes of a mix of honey and sugar very sweet . It tasted of ginger and slight lemon flavor ; but after each swallow , I got the hot ginger burn . Too much of a burn to sooth my throat . Hotter than most ginger snaps I eat . It was like after eating a jalapneo pepper . Much hotter than the black pepper after burn of chai tea . It was way too hot for me to finish . Maybe milk will melow it out , but I can not mix lemon and milk . <brÂ /> If you like hot spicy drinks or love ginger then this is for you .

Sweet ginger drinks with a spicy kick after swallowing . Not for me .
