It 's amazing that you ca n't get the most basic pickling ingredients in the grocery stores . Most stores only stock pickling alum mixed with spices and herbs in finished packages . Does this mean we all have the same taste now ? Are we all from the same cookie cutter ? NO ! <br /> <br /> Thank goodness there are stores which still cater for those who want to cook the old fashioned way ... with individuality .
