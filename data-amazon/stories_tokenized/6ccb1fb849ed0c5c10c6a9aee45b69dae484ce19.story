Some reviewers have had poor luck with this product . However , I have been luckier . The wasabi taste is pretty evenly distributed -- and , boy , does it make this healthy treat go to another level . If you do n't like the heat of wasabi , obviously , stay away from this . But if you do , it comes through pretty well -LRB- at least for me -RRB- . <br /> <br /> In nutritional terms , this represents a good source of protein . It is a l.ow carb dish ; it also has no cholesterol -LRB- if the statistuics are accurate -RRB- . Also , no trans-fat . <br /> <br /> Ingredients are simple : soybeans , sea salt , and wasabi powder . <br /> <br /> I like simply eating it out of the bag as a healthy snack .
