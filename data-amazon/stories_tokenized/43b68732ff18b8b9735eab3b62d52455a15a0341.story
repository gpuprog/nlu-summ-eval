Fiber One Raisin Bran Clusters are , simply put , delicious . Fiber One took a great type of cereal and made it taste much , much better than the other Raisin Bran cereals out there . In addition , this cereal is truly chock full of dietary fiber . It tastes great in milk and it even makes a good snack for when you 're `` on the go . '' <br /> <br /> In addition , the cereal has potassium , iron and zero cholesterol . Excellent ! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately , however , all this goodness comes at a price . There 's a lot of dietary fiber ; but this also contains a comparatively level of carbohydrates in each portion . Perhaps you think that 45 grams of carbs per cup is OK ; and maybe it is if you do n't have a diet filled with carbs the rest of your day . Compare it to Cheerios or Quaker Oats , however , and you 'll see right away you can get other healthy cereals that are quite good for you with far fewer carbs and much less sugar . Oatmeal has good dietary fiber , too , although not as much as this cereal has . <br /> <br /> Overall , Fiber One Raisin Bran is probably the best raisin bran cereal I 've ever eaten . It 's great ; but because of certain health issues I would n't actually eat this every day unless you need carbs for some reason . It 's a mixed bag type of product . Eat this and enjoy it ; but also switch off between this and other healthy cereals like Cheerios and Quaker Oats .
