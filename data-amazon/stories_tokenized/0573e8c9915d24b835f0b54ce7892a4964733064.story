I recently ordered these and was extremely disappointed . Here were the problems : <br /> <br /> 1 -RRB- OLD !! They actually tasted dusty and I could feel no potency in them at all . <br /> 2 -RRB- Wolfberries not Goji Berries . Since I 've consumed Goji 's from many sources over the years , I know which are the highest quality Goji 's -LRB- usually quite expensive -RRB- , which are less potent , and which are the different tasting Wolfberry variety that many sellers pass off as Goji 's but are not the same . Wolfberry has its own benefits -LRB- not nearly those of Goji IMO -RRB- , but for Wolfberries these are widly overpriced . You can get the same in Chinese stores for probably closer to $ 10 for twice the amount . <br /> <br /> With the dollar devaluation top quality Goji berries have gotten very expensive for regular use . So if you 're looking for cheaper alternatives like I was here , look elsewhere . Check out some of the cheap goji berries -LRB- that are in fact wolfberries and usually say so -RRB- on Ebay from Chinese sources . They 'll be quite a bit cheaper and likely quite a bit fresher .
