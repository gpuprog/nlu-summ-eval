This is definitely the best coconut milk I can find . I especially like the organic version . The other brand referred to in these reviews is chemically altered . They add water and preserve it with sulfites - toxic and I 'm allergic to them . Also , when you buy a ` lite ' version of coconut milk , you are just paying for the company to water it down for you . You can add your own water at home if you do n't like as much fat . But this is healthy fat -LRB- which can help you lose weight-study Dr. Young 's New Biology -RRB- and coconuts are so good for you , especially the green/young ones .
