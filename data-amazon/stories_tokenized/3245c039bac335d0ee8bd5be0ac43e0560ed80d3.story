These Ostrim Turkey Sticks are great ! There are multiple flavors and though I like the Peppered best -LRB- I like hot and spicy foods -RRB- , the Applewood also tastes very good and those who do not like spicy food at all should be pleased with the smoky flavor . Ostrim products are also very low in calories and fat compared to similar products , and for a very comparable price ; you are getting a healthy product for a good price .
