. . that was a complaint from another customer who posted pics of her moldy cake on a popular social networking site , right after I posted my disappointment with the company . It solified my position to notify potential customers of what they are getting here . <br /> <br /> **** I 'm writing this review as someone who received a FREE cake . <br /> <br /> I was so excited to receive my Fantasicake , but my excitement quickly turned to disappointment . My fantasicake was more like a sweet lover 's nightmare ! Icing everywhere ! I thought I could salvage it by scraping it off the box but was caked up and dried . It looks like the lid for the icing was n't completely sealed and all the icing spilled in the box during transit . <br /> <br /> Fantasicakes DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY ICE PACKS during transit , nor do they put your cake in styrofoam . They pack it in a plastic bag -LRB- unsealed , not shrinkwrapped etc -RRB- in a cardboard box . During the height of the summer , many areas reach triple degrees , and the UPS warehouses and trucks are even hotter . The fact that they do n't put ANY gel icepacks to help keep your cake cool during transit , ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMERTIME , really is shocking to me . <br /> <br /> My cake was warm when it arrived so i took it out of the shipping box , opened the lid of the cake box just to look at it , and icing was everywhere . I took a couple pics to show the company and immediately popped it in the fridge to cool down . During that time , I emailed Fantasicakes to tell them about the spilled icings and suggested that more care should be taken in packaging the items . <br /> <br /> The response I got was interesting . They know about the hot weather and clearly they know they do n't include icepacks . They also know how rough delivery people are with packages . Offering me an extra cake with next purchase that could possibly be molded by the time it arrives ? NO THANKS . <br /> <br /> Again , It must also be noted that I 'm writing this review as someone who received a FREE cake . I have no axe to grind here . I want to give you guys an honest impression of what you will get from this company . While I thought the prices were great for a delivered cake , I ca n't take chances on sending a gift that is inadequately packaged for a perishable item and may arrive moldy . Prior to receiving the cake , I intended to purchase one for all the older women in the family as `` just because '' gifts . Not now !
