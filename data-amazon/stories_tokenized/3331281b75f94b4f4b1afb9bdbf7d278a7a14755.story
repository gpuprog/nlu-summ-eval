Do n't expect to have your world blown away by this salmon and it is definitely hot smoked so it is a little dense . That being said , it has a nice clean flavor and is cryosealed so you do n't have to deal with cans . My purpose for buying this was to replace turkey on my sandwiches and this is a perfect application of this salmon for only a fraction more than what I pay for turkey . <br /> <br /> Great buy for the money and I will definitely keep my subscription .
