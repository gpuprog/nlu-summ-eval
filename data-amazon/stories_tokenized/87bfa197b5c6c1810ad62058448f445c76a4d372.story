I lived in Santa Barbara for more than twenty years and ate at Pea Soup Andersens in Solvang many times before moving back to Wisconsin 5 years ago . The flavor and consistency of this soup is wonderful . -LRB- I add a little bit of diced ham to it -RRB- . I had my sister bring a few cans with her on a visit but was reconciled to the fact that , like tri-tip , there are a few things that I ca n't get here in Wisconsin . Imagine my delight and surprise when a search for Pea Soup Andersens brought a link to amazon.com . I have ordered a dozen cans every year since and enjoy having a little bit of Santa Barbara here .
