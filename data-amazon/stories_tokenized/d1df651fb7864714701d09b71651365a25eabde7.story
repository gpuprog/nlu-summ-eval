I first fell in love with Stash 's Wild Raspberry Herbal Tea on a recent trip to San Francisco . The little , european style hotel I stayed in offered this yummy tea 24-7 and I found myself stopping to grab a cup at least 3x a day . The tea has a strong , raspberry fruit flavor that is crisp enough to please your tongue and keep you hydrated , but without the keep-you-up-all-night caffeine . I instantly began craving the flavor . <br /> <br /> When I flew back to the east coast I was sad to realize that I could n't find it in my local grocery store . I quickly hopped on Amazon and was happy to find that I can have the tea shipped to me . -LRB- YEA ! Amazon ! -RRB- . Buying in the 100-count boxes is the cheapest option I 've found , however , be warned that the 100-count box delivers the tea bags loose -LRB- they 're in their separate , pink tea pouches , but loose in the box -RRB- , which can be a cabinet disaster if you do not have a tea box or other place to keep the 100 tea bags under rule . <br /> <br /> The tea is great hot or cold over ice ... you absolutely ca n't go wrong with this fruity tea !
