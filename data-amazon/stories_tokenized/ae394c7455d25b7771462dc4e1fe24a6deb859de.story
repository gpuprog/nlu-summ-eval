These are what a bread stick should be . They are light , crispy and very thin , like pencils or straws in diameter . They come packaged in plastic serving pouches in the box so the whole box wo n't go stale if you are just having a few with a salad or soup . <br /> I got them after seeing a recipe for Pocky like candies that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061658197"> The Pioneer Woman Cooks : Recipes from an Accidental Country Girl </a> posted in her blog . They made a great base for the chocolate coating and there were n't many broken in the box I got . I think they would be lovely served in bud vases at a dinner party to go with soup as well . <br /> I ca n't wait to try the garlic.Without the chocolate of course .
