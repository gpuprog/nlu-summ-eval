We 've been on a low-refined-carb diet for two years now . I found this cereal at my local whole foods grocery for almost $ 10 a bag , and even at that price enjoyed it enough to keep buying it . Finding it on Amazon for about half that much was a happy surprise . These Os are tasty and very crunchy , and resist sogginess way longer than the old standard Cheerios .
