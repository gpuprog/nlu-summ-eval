When my daughter was born she was on similac since I was not able to fully breast feed her , so in the following weeks we used it and it was fine until she developed baby acne and spit it up a lot , then we heard about Earth 's Best . We decided to try it out and it 's been a great decision ever since . She no longer spits it up -LRB- as much . . -RRB- and no baby acne . We are definitely recommend this product . The shipping has been impeccable every time I order it . There are no complaints here ...
