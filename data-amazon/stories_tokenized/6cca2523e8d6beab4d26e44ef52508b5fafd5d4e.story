This is my favorite cereal ever and was disappointed when my local grocery quit selling it . I have tried multiple healthy cereals since to try and replace it but keep coming back to this . Glad to find it reasonably priced here . Lots of cinnamon taste but not overly sweet , my teenage son fights me for the open box .
