My kids love their Macaroni & Cheese but one day all we had was a generic brand . They did n't eat it all that well -LRB- Kraft really is the best -RRB- so I decided to try to make it a little better for them . Follow the recipe on the box with a couple exceptions . Put one slice of velveeta chees in while melting the butter -LRB- I melt the butter while the noodles are draining so as to melt the butter and velveeta faster -RRB- and add 1/3 cup milk . What you 'll have is a less expensive version of the really creamy macaroni and cheese that Kraft sells for a lot more money . By adding extra milk and cheese they 're even getting more calcium . My kids love it when I throw in hot dogs and even peas so feel free to throw in other things since it 's so cheesy -LRB- the extra cheesy sauce will take things like peas that kids do n't normally eat and make them taste good -RRB- . Give it a try and see what you and/or your kids think !
