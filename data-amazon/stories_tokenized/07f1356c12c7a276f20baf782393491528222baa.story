I purchased the 20 pack to go along with the Whirley Pop popcorn maker . This is really great tasting popcorn , nearly every kernel pops . It truly is as close to real movie theater popcorn as you can get . I will be purchasing this again . If you do n't have a Whirley Pop , you might consider getting it as well , the two products are great together .
