After a lot of research , not just into types of dry cat food but what was readily available in a variety of local shops -LRB- since I had no intention of being dependent on having food shipped in specially -RRB- I decided on Science Diet Kitten for my cat , then a kitten , Whisper . She loved the small shape of the food and immediately took to it , though she put on just a tad more weight than was needed . <br /> <br /> The space of a year later and I 've moved to a far more rural area where even a handy selection of Science Diet was n't available ! I 'd picked the stuff mainly for it 's availability and never been truly satisfied with the amount of protein it offered . Now Whisper is full grown , just this side of being obese and also suffering relatively constant stomach upset . <br /> <br /> Since availability was no longer the issue I went looking for a food in comparable price range , size of kibble , with a higher protein content and found Orijen . Whisper took to it immediately . Stopped having stomach problems . Her coat improved -LRB- she used to shed constantly even when using the furminator on her daily , now hardly at all -RRB- and most surprisingly - has lost several pounds on the exact same portion size ! Whisper enjoys the small easy to crunch kibbles , is thrilled with her new food and I 'm thrilled that she seems to be a healthier , happier cat without expensive vet bills or a steep spike in expenses ! <br /> <br /> Got a new kitten recently and started her right out with Origen . I ca n't imagine ever going back to something like Science Diet which even my vet says is like McDonald 's for animals .
