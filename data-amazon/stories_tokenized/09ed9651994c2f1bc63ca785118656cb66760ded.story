I found this at Costco -LRB- for quite a bit less than here on Amazon -RRB- and purchased it . It is absolutely delicious -LRB- subjective , I know -- I 'm not sure how else to present a review on a food item -RRB- and has been great on chicken and fish . It is definitely sweet -LRB- not candy sweet by any means -RRB- and not comprised of the healthiest ingredients , but if that does n't turn someone off , it 's definitely worth a try . I ordered from Amazon after Costco stopped selling them in my area and my supply started to run low .
