I watched Dr. OZ on television and he was explaining how to minimize and/or avoid crows feet . His advice ? Drinking Fenugreek tea , taking L-Arginine supplements and getting a good nights ' sleep -LRB- 6 hour min . -RRB- . Well , I am going to give it a shot . This tea has an interesting taste-not your typical tea but not bad . It tastes pretty good with a bit of honey added actually . I was n't able to find this tea in any local supermarkets but here it is on Amazon . Seems they have everything !
