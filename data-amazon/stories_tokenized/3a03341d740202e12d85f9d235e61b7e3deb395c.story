The black salt seems a little bit mouisture . When you are seasoning in you dish or pan , the black colour may spread over . <br /> <br /> `` Although not as popular as the traditional red alaea salt , hawaiian black sea salt , or lava salt , is a dramatic , glossy black sea salt . The unique color comes from lava , which adds minerals and activated charcoal which results in a sulfuric aroma and earthy flavor . <br /> <br /> hawaiian black sea salt is used both as a finishing salt and a roasting salt . It is often used as a coating on fish to help preserve both flavor and moisture as it bakes . <br /> <br /> suggested uses : <br /> <br /> Delicious on all types of seafoods , especially shellfish such as clams , mussels or scallops .
