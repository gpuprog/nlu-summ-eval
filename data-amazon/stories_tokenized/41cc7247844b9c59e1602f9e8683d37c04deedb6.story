Normally I hate yucky flowery herbs like hibiscus and rosehips and mint in my tea -LRB- such as Celestial Seasonings Tea -RRB- but one day while at Starbuck 's , I was hot and wanted an iced drink but not coffee and since I 'm really a tea drinker , I tried their Tazo iced teas and they tasted SOOOOO good with just the purrrrfect balance of just enough herbs but still letting your senses know it was still TEA and the orange with mint fragrance/taste comes out boldly !! The heated tea is nicely turned immediately , boldly , vividly , orange in color . I do n't need to add much sweetener even as it 's tart but its tartness gives it more taste . <br /> <br /> The only drawbacks are its high price -LRB- compared to other teas which is why I 'm always waiting for a sale on them -RRB- and having to wait to heat the water and waiting to cool it down in the refrigerator -LRB- or quickly in the freezer -RRB- . It 's true as another reviewer said that it 's very strong in taste after just leaving it in hot water for a few seconds so the longer you leave it in , the stronger and bitter or more tart it becomes and you could really be frugal and only need a tea bag for a half gallon to a gallon of water . Adding ice helps dilute the taste as well as cool the tea down fast and cold , but I like my iced tea strong so i can taste its full flavor , so I try never to add ice . <br /> <br /> It 's a delight as an everyday iced tea as well as a great gift for a friend .
