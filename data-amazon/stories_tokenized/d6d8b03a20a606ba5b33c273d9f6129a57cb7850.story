I frequently purchase ThinkThin bars , and when I see a good price from Amazon , I jump . However , in the last 2 purchases , the product has arrived in moderately poor condition . The box of crunch bars was damaged and repaired with tape . One bar was missing . Twice I have purchased the peanut butter bars and both times the chocolate was powdery and cakey as if it had been stored in a less than optimal temperature range . They were within the sell-by date , but had that `` too old '' look . I will not purchase through Amazon again .
