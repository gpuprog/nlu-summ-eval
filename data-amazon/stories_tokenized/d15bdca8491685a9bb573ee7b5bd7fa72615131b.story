We have a floor standing popcorn machine and tried a few different products before getting this one . We stopped looking when we got this ! It 's the bomb ! We love it and buy it by the case . It 's the real deal , and I highly recommend it . We top it with ` popping and topping ' for more butter flavor , but many of our guests like it just as is . Just a heads up , the ` oil ' portion is somewhat solid when it comes , not watery .
