Brewed on the 10 oz . setting on my Keurig Platinum brewer , the first thing I noticed was the very nice , enticing aroma . Could this possibly be the perfect K-cup ? I had to have a sip before I even sat down . In that first sip I tasted some strength , some choclate and nutty overtones , followed by a smoothness I do n't typically find in a Starbucks blend . <br /> <br /> For the most part I do n't drink Starbucks for several reasons . First and foremost , they tend to over roast their beans and the result is an overly strong and somewhat bitter brew . This Veranda Blend `` Blond '' brew is n't roasted so darkly and finally I can taste the real flavors in the coffee . This coffee actually reminds me of what a good `` Donut Shop '' coffee used to taste like ; before everything became darkly roasted . But I stray ... The first sip as I said was very inviting with lots of interesting flavors and a lively yet balanced acidity . As the coffee cooled in my cup the flavor changed a little . It became more woodsy and earthy but with a bit more acidity . Still a good cup that comes close to my favorite K-cup , Millstone 's Fog Lifter . Foglifter is a blend of both dark and light roasts in which the flavor does n't change as the cup cools , the first sip is as good as the last . The acidity is always balanced whereas with this Veranda Blend the acidity becomes slightly more pronouncd . <br /> <br /> I usually prefer a light to medium roast in the morning and throughout the day . In the evening I like to relax with a darker roast or better yet with a real espresso -LRB- which sadly can not be made in a Keurig -RRB- . My verdict for the Veranda Roast is that it will fill the bill for my everyday coffee if and when the Millstone Foglifter either is n't available at a reasonable price or is out of stock . <br /> <br /> The price you pay for this good Veranda Roast is , well , the price , and this is my reason for the deduction of a star . Starbucks has long been priced higher than other coffees and the Veranda is no exception . This is only a 16-count box which means we 're paying right at a dollar a cup . At the Keurig website I can buy Foglifter for around sixty-two cents per cup when it is in stock . Am I being cheap ? Maybe . I just do n't find Starbucks to be worth the extra money just to have the brand name .
