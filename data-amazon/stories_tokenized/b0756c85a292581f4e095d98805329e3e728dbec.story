My girlfriend and I have been rescuing , fostering , and adopting out -LRB- through a rescue group -RRB- cats and kittens for over 10 years . We also have a number of feline companions that live with us and bring us a lot of joy . So we 're very experienced in all aspects of cat care , and we always try to feed our feline companions high quality foods . The foods are more expensive , but worth it for the health and well-being of our beloved companions ! <br /> <br /> We had been using Innova Cat & Kitten Dry Cat Food for several years , once we discovered that it included no by-products , corn filler , or other junk ingredients . Our cats loved the food , which we mixed with another high quality dry food for variety . <br /> <br /> Fast forward to our experiences over the last few months . We heard that Proctor & Gamble , manufacturer of IAMS and other junk cat foods , had purchased Natura Pet Products , maker of the Innova , Healthwise , and California Natural brands , among others . Proctor & Gamble has questionable pet food testing practices -LRB- search the internet for it -RRB- , so we naturally never buy their products and do not want to support the company in any way . So we were very upset about P&G 's purchase of Natura , but we stuck with the Innova Cat & Kitten food for the short run , hoping we could later find a better alternative . <br /> <br /> Well strangely enough , for the last 10 or so 15lb bags of Innova Cat & Kitten that we 've purchased , something has changed . The food is much more `` crumbly '' , i.e. there is a lot more `` food dust '' in the bags , and the kibble looks a little different . We did n't think much of this change until our cats , which had previously LOVED the Innova food , lost interest in it and really did n't want to eat it . In the dry food mix we make , we noticed that very often , the cats would eat the other part of the mix , and leave the Innova Cat & Kitten behind . Clearly there is something different about the way P&G manufactures this food , as opposed to how it USED to be made by Natura Pet Products . <br /> <br /> This is EXPENSIVE food , and for the money you pay , it should be TOP QUALITY . Well , it IS N'T anymore ! We finally reached our boiling point one day when we looked around at all the cat food bowls -LRB- which are usually totally empty after feeding time -RRB- , and saw that much of the Innova part of the mix was leftover , unwanted . <br /> <br /> So that was it ; we returned our last 3 large bags of Innova Cat & Kitten to the store we 'd purchased them from , and will never buy this food again . In fact , we 've now decided to never buy ANY Natura products , which include Healthwise and California Natural . We did find a good quality alternative cat food called `` Simply Nourish '' , and when we tried it with our cats , they LOVED it . There is no longer ANY food leftover in their bowls , and we know the new food we are feeding is good quality . <br /> <br /> WARNING : For anyone currently purchasing `` Innova Cat & Kitten '' , or planning to buy it in the future , we believe that P&G appears to have changed the way this food is made , for the worse . We can only assume that this large company was trying to save money , and in so doing have ruined one of the formerly best brands of food on the market . AVOID this food , it does NOT appear to contain the same formula/ingredients as it did before P&G bought Natura Pet Products , and ruined it !
