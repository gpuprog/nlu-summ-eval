I 've never had an appletini , so I ca n't say if this Crystal Light mix tastes like one . However , it does taste like some apple juice that I 've had . though , if the juice had had the glowing chlorophyll color of the appletini mix , I do n't think I would have tried it.Good taste ; alarming color .
