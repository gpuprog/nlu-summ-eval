Even though the picture shows `` Gevalia '' brand coffee discs , and even though that 's what the product is called , it 's actually Maxwell House Brand . The seller at least emailed me to let me know that -LRB- after of course the product was already on its way -RRB- . <br /> <br /> The product itself is n't that great . The milk discs do n't always work correctly and it does n't taste nearly as good as most of the other Tassimo drinks .
