Like all the coffee I 've tasted for the Keurig this is pretty weak . Actually , this is some of the weakest . I suppose one could be polite and call it `` subtle '' but I 'm not that person . It does provide just the right amount of caffeine I need for a late afternoon boost and still let me sleep at night so it does serve its purpose . <brÂ /> Is there any strong and complex coffee for this machine ?
