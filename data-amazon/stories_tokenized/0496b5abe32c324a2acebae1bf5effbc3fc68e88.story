Wow ! This was a surprise . While the other reviews tempted me to try it ... and i figured my kids would love it -LRB- anything with chocolate and peanutbutter is a winner -RRB- ... i was mightily surprised to find that all the adults ate it before the kids could get any . <br /> <br /> Very easy to prepare and a quick , light -LRB- if you leave off the topping and the crust -RRB- dessert that goes great after a pork meal . <br /> <br /> Thanks Amazon for offering it ! i HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who enjoys a reeses cup .
