The whole fam gobbled them down ! I did n't get more than 2 I think . I am not familiar with these but my husband is all wild about them so I ordered some this year . I got the buy 3 deal . There were NO other deals on Amazon and they were wayyy expensive at the BAM stores around here if they even had them at all . They are really pretty in the box . I could n't tell the different flavors apart . I gave the other boxes to my landlord and in-laws .
