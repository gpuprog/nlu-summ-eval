I had these on Subscribe & Save but sadly , it was canceled some months ago . My family and I actually liked this mix better than the one in the boxes , It seems to have more flavor . I used it at least once a week and never had any leftovers . I never used butter , margarine or oil on it . just water and the mix itself and it was always delicious . Sometimes , I added some chopped onions and celery , also yummy . The price was also very reasonable and the packaging always just right . Sorry to see it disappear from Amazon 's Sunscribe & Save .
