Just so you all know these are $ 7.50 at Wal-Mart so I recommend you do n't buy these . But yet on the other hand this could also look like a good deal because if you buy these out of a vending machine they could cost as much as $ 1.00 a pouch which would equal $ 36.00 for all of these . So you are basically getting these half off if you use vending machines a lot . But if you get these at Wal-Mart it 's like getting 2 big cases which is -LRB- 72 -RRB- pouches for the current price of `` one '' box on here which is -LRB- $ 16.94 -RRB- . Just be smart while shopping on here and compare prices in the store before you buy online . Happy shopping .
