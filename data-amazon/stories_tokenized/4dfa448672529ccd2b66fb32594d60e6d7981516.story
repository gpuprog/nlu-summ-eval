These Honey Buns are so good . I do have to agree with the other reviewer though about these being a bit to sweet . I 've learned that if I 'm going to eat these I should have a glass of milk on hand because that helps them not taste to sweet . But other then that these are really yummy as a snack especially if you 're on the go .
