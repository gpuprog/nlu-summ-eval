Barring an unfortunate allergy to either cinnamon or almonds , this is a great pairing of flavors to spice up Raisin Bran with that should not be missed if your a fan of the original -LRB- and who is n't ?! -RRB- . I 've always enjoyed Raison Bran , even at the risk of it 's somewhat serious side effects , most notably sugar shock and/or your stomach turning into an atomic bomb . Of course like anything else , if used responsibly these effects can be avoided -- yet here I sit eating my fourth bowl ... and in ten minutes my world will be upside down . Still , great cereal , worth the risks , and highly recommended -LRB- just eat with caution -RRB- !
