For those tea drinkers who happen to love ginger snap cookies , or those great old time `` windmill cookies . '' Now a tea can never replace the taste but this evokes the flavor . Its good for those who just like the flavor of ginger or are on `` If-it-tastes-good - spit-it-out '' type of diet . Enjoy !
