I did place an order with Amazon for this particular item , but it was canceled because the supplier at the time was not able to provide it -LRB- it was not PetFoodDirect - I have had excellent service from them through Amazon -RRB- . I managed to order the 4Eva through another source , and the kitties like it . It was something I wanted because the majority of BFF -LRB- and Soulistic , made by the same company -RRB- are tuna based -LRB- other fish added too , but mostly tuna and fish -RRB- . Once in a while it would be nice to have something else ; we get tired of the same thing every meal too ! In general the BFF foods are a good choice - better quality , not outrageous prices .

BFF is better food than some and not as expensive as others
