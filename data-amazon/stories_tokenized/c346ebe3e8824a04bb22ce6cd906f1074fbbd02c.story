Even though I write reviews mostly on my favorite types of escape novels , I was sparked by Amazon 's enthusiasm , to take part in the grocery store and gourmet food expansions here . My first purchase -LRB- of products beyond books -RRB- included a grain called QUINOA -LRB- Keenwa . <br /> <br /> The product arrived in very good order and within perfect timing . <br /> <br /> In that maiden purchase I also added lavender and clove essential oils to my shopping cart , along with powdered cloves , and lavender tea . See my Listmania on Essential Oils -LRB- which indicates which items I 've reviewed -RRB- for info on the values and uses of lavender and cloves , available from various vendors here . <br /> <br /> I consider Quinoa to be the most valuable food available on the planet , a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor -LRB- and culinary versatility -RRB- , in addition to being baseline healthy with full-spectrum nourishment . <br /> <br /> If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups -LRB- in addition to water , of course -RRB- to eat or drink , those would be Quinoa , Coffee , Dairy Products , and a variety of greens , spices , & nuts . Yeah , okay , dairy products ; and greens , spices , & nuts may be considered more than 2 items , but , for me they 're two categories . <br /> <br /> I 'm not a vegetarian because I love meat , chicken , and fish , but if I 'm working with limitations , I 'm making do with the most basic of basics , while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor -LRB- yeah , yeah , and nutrition , too , though according to my beliefs , `` nutrition '' dims and deteriorates , unless it 's in the living presence of `` yummy . '' -RRB- . <br /> <br /> Quinoa , I believe , would take care of all -LRB- or at least many -RRB- basic nutritional needs . <br /> <br /> The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal , and then to `` gourmet it '' accordingly . <br /> <br /> -- As `` rice '' I add savory herbs like parsley , basil , marjoram , garlic , onions , etc. . Actually , most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa . Think of what Lidia 's Italian Table does with `` noodle heaven '' ; then substitute Quinoa for pasta -LRB- I like pasta too , of course -RRB- . <br /> <br /> -- As `` oatmeal '' I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit -LRB- including raisin and date types -RRB- , brown sugar , molasses , maple , creme , that type of thing . <br /> <br /> As far as cooking instructions , to me they 're basically the same as rice : <br /> <br /> - Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio . 2 cups liquid -LRB- water , broth , vegetable , or fruit juices -RRB- to 1 cup Quinoa . <br /> <br /> -- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa , covering the pot , and simmering for 12-15 minutes . <br /> <br /> -- I 've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave . You can heat the water to boil in a bowl then add Quinoa , cover , and cook . Normally , a microwave cooks 4 times faster than `` outside-the-waves '' cooking , but , of course that time varies with larger amounts of food . For example , 1 potato cooks -LRB- on average -RRB- in 4 - 8 minutes , 2 potatoes require double that , or 8 -16 minutes . <br /> <br /> -- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave , I might use 1/4 cup Quinoa with 2/4 -LRB- 1/2 -RRB- cup liquid . <br /> <br /> I have actually simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts -LRB- Quinoa and water in a bowl -RRB- in the microwave , and cooking it on high , maybe 3 minutes , till the liquid bubbles . Then I cover the bowl with a plate `` lid '' ; zap it for another minute or half , then let it `` steep '' in the microwave , without opening it , for another few minutes . -LRB- Since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ , you 'll have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you , or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag . -RRB- <br /> <br /> In the microwave , Quinoa seems to cook easier than rice . <br /> <br /> But , I also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method . I do n't use minute rice , since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly , and if I cook it in a serving bowl with a plate `` lid '' I can just place it on the table for family style `` digging in . '' <br /> <br /> I love the nutty , barley flavor of Quinoa . Thankfully , so does my husband ! <br /> <br /> In the past I 've purchased Quinoa from Bob 's Red Mill , and White Mountain Farms in Colorado , in the San Juan mountain area -LRB- have always been satisfied with those sellers , when/if the products are available on Amazon -RRB- . Having used many different Now Foods products , I 'm very confident in ordering any item from them . <br /> <br /> Recently Berry Farm and Angelinas have been added to my list of healthful , gourmet food purveyors . The reviews on Angelina 's and Quinoa Red were helpful . In addition to the most common golden grain , I 've only seen black Quinoa , which is also appealing , and is reportedly the oldest variety . Well , actually all the reviews I 've read on Quinoa have offered something of value to the info I 've already gathered . -LRB- I used to sell Quinoa in my CITY CHEF kitchen store , which is no longer open ; I spend all my time writing now , with a little cooking on the side . -RRB- <br /> <br /> Quinoa has an iteresting history , including the development of a saponin coating on the grain : <br /> <br /> -- The genetics in the Quinoa seeds , after eons and ages of growing , had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varment 's , like worms or parasites . <br /> <br /> -- Knowing what saponin is and does , I began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse Quinoa for watering my plants , or pouring on the ground where I might want to discourage insects . <br /> <br /> -- Once the saponin is removed , I 'm not sure how long the `` naked '' grains will be able to protect themselves again parasitic invasions . Certainly , Quinoa -LRB- being a very strong , wise-old-grain with high integrity , for many reasons -RRB- would be able to do so longer than other similar , eons-younger food offerings . I 'm not concerned about this , and will usually order either pre-washed grain or saponin coated , whichever is readily available . <br /> <br /> Quinoa grows only above a 7,000-foot-elevation and requires a certain growing climate , which can be found only in certain areas of the world . Some parts of the Rocky Mountains are one of those areas , not tested until fairly recently -LRB- in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the Incas -RRB- . <br /> <br /> Interesting stories about Quinoa 's long history are bountiful , but I wo n't get into those . A large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it , and of course , many are offered here on Amazon . <br /> <br /> I remain ever thankful for magical foods -LRB- which are both gourmet and healthy in quality -RRB- , especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life , magic , wholeness , and flavor out of most everything . For the sake of `` health '' ? <br /> <br /> Here 's an interesting question to ponder : <br /> <br /> Why and how , for a while -LRB- eons -RRB- , did we lose Quinoa seeds , which had `` lived '' long enough to develop saponin . Why and how did we find them again ? <br /> <br /> For an easy , exotic recipe using Quinoa , see my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024CW1O"> Virgin Coconut Oil -LRB- Certified Organic -RRB- 12 fl.oz </a> <br /> <br /> Linda Shelnutt <br /> Author of several books , including : <br /> Molasses Moon
