My bonsai seemed fine for about a week , and then it started dropping leaves , just like all the others ' . Unlike everyone else who 's posted here , I found out why . I watered and inspected the tree and found little -LRB- .5 mm -RRB- silver mites running around in the soil -- lots of them . <br /> I did a lot of research and then eventually took it to a local nursery where they said and my bonsai came with a nice little infestation of thrips palmi . <br /> Thrips are a common glasshouse and factory nursery infestation that attack the roots of young plants . To an adult plant , thrips themselves do minimal damage even in large numbers but can stunt or warp growth by feeding on terminal shoots , the undersides of leaves , causing them to drop . Each of my dropped jade leaves had a small brown spot at the base where thrips had been feeding . The real danger from thrips is that they carry Watermelon silver mottle virus that makes your leaves turn silver and shrivel up . <br /> <br /> The reason the leaves start dropping is that thrips love the warm dry air of a house or apartment and the parasite population explodes when you house the plant indoors as advertised . <br /> <br /> Anyway , in summary , they mention they are the biggest US distributor of bonsai , and I believe them , 'cause my bonsai has the parasites to prove it ! DO NOT BUY !
