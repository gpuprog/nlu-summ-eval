Hard to find here in the Portland OR burbs . I like Luzianne better than Lipton . The price is not bad when buying a package of 4 . These are family size tea bags -LRB- 1 bag per 1 quart of water -RRB- . To make different flavors I mix these tea bags with other flavors -- i.e. blackberry sage from Rep. of Tea .
