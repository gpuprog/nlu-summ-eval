I spotted this exquisite treat at a local gourmet food store and had to give them a try . Excellent flavor and texture , quite unique . And now I ca n't find them locally anymore , so glad to see them here . <br /> <br /> St. Dalfour raisins and cranberries are completely different from those which are packed dry . These are moist ! And tender and truly delightful . The ingredients listed on the label are : `` raisins , cranberries and ' a touch of sugar . ' '' No preservatives -LRB- other than the sugar , of course -RRB- . <br /> <br /> These raisins and cranberries are vacuum packed in glass jars and remain moist and plump . I do n't know how St. Dalfour achieves this , but the resulting product is simply delectable . <br /> <br /> A tasty treat right off the jar , but even better in desserts -LRB- ricotta torte , clafouti , bread pudding -RRB- . <br /> <br /> Made in France .
