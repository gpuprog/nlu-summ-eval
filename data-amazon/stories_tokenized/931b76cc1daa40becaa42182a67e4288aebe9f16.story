I 'm a busy mom with two jobs and a 6 month old . I want to make my own baby food but I really do n't even have five extra minutes to do that . HappyBaby pouches are my go to ! I started adding Apple Cherry to my daughters cereal because she did n't want to eat the rice cereal plain . Now she gobbles it up ! I feel good that she is getting awesome organic fruit in her cereal that does n't have added sugar or color and it only took me a few seconds to get it prepared for her .
