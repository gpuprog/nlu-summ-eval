Saves time and money . Gives you the option to brew your favorite blend at any strength you like . Take a small pampered chef knife cut around inside foil of cup . Wash out used coffee rub the paper lightly with your finger while washing and let dry . You can blow into bottom of cup while wet and let the filter dry on the counter . This pushes the filter out to dry faster .
