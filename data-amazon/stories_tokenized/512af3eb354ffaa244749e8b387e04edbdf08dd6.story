Granted I have n't tasted all of the extra bold varieties yet , but I ordered the Coffee People `` Jet Fuel '' because of the user reviews . I agree wholeheartedly - Jet Fuel is the best tasting k-cup I 've tasted thus far . The sample `` dark '' coffees that came with the Keurig coffee maker had me thinking I had made a mistake . <br /> <br /> I am a Starbucks expresso drinker usually . I have a really good Jura expresso maker , but it has been on the fritz , and starting the day without coffee is not an option . Thank you Coffee People for helping me start my day right :-RRB-
