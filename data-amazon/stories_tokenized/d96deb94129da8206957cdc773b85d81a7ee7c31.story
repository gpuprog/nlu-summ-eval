It shipped Jan 19 and arrived Feb 1 , so it took 12 days to arrive . I had to throw it away.Too bad because the first pizza I bought was really good and i intended to make it a steady purchase.But now I 'm not so sure I trust this company again . <br /> <br /> I wanted to come back and write a better review.Since I love all these pizzas , I ordered again -LRB- and then again -RRB- and now I get my orders with no problems.I do not know what happened with the first order but this one arrived in good time and the pizzas were wonderful . <br /> I must say thses pizzas are so good they have spoiled me for eating any other pizzas.Even the ones in my home town.I have tried all the flavors Naan has and I love them all.I will continue to buy them < 3
