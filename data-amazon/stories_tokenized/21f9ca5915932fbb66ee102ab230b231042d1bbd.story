When I first tried one of these snack bars , it reminded me of other high fiber bars I 've eaten over the years . The chocolate flavor is light but does add a nice combination with the banana . My wife took them to work for colleagues to sample . They ate the whole box in one setting and everyone really liked them . The most common reaction including my own is that they are a little dry , but otherwise pretty good .

Good but Dry
