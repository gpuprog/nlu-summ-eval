These treats are great ! They 're yummy ! They have such a perfect consistency , not too hard , not soft at all . They do n't get gummy when they 're chewed for awhile so mom does n't mind picking them up after they 've been chewed on for a bit . Sometimes she has to do that 'cause we get obsessed with chewing them on occasion and we just wo n't put them down ! -LRB- OK , I admit , that 's me ... `` Banshee '' . I am a Himalayolic but I do n't need help . I just need more Himalayan Dog Chews and mom found them at Amazon.com for the best price anywhere ! -RRB- <br /> These treats are hard and crunchy and stay that way , they only get a tiny hint of softness as chewed . We have to work at it but small pieces flake off and we get our tasty reward ! They make great dental bones because they have more flavor and have stiff edges to help rub along our teeth and break off the tarter . Oh , and they do n't have the foul odor of hoof chewies or some others . Mom and dad gag when we chew hoofies but they love the Himalayan Chews . <br /> Did I say they are great ? Well I meant they are outstanding ! They are wonderful and all three of us love them so much that on occasion we have fought over them . That 's because `` Zac '' likes to horde them and tries to hide them all . He 's stopped that now since mom worked with him . That 's great because now she can leave 4-5 out , -LRB- more than the number of dogs is smart -RRB- , without worry of a fight . <br /> One warning is that you should watch your dog as they get down near the end of the chew . `` Li '' is a real aggressive eater and when he gets to that last inch he 'll swallow it whole ! One of these times I 'm worried it may get stuck in his intestine and require surgery since I 'm uncertain how well a large chunk will be digested . Regular chunks appear to be fully digested since it never hurts going poddy and mom never complains about chunks in our poops , BOL -LRB- Bark out loud -RRB- . <br /> We 've been receiving these fine treats since they first came on the market and we 've had no trouble . We -LRB- mostly -RRB- are average to above average chewers with lots of experience with these chews and we 'd recommend you try them with your dogs . Like any chew , you should stick around and observe us as we chew but for light to moderate chewers you might be watching for hours and even then we may not finish one since it 's highly dependent on the aggressiveness of the chewer . Crazy mad chewers like `` Li '' have been known to bite down on even the large ones and snap it in two , which is great 'cause then I get another one ! Our mom watches us well and picks the chews up when she can not watch us . I think that 's smart for ALL chews . Now , go on ! What are you waiting for ? Go buy some for `` Max '' and `` Hannah '' !
