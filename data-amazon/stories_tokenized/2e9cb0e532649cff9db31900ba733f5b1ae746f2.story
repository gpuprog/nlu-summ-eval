My cats are real picky about trying new foods . I popped open 2 cans -LRB- 1 yellowfin & 1 tuna and sole -RRB- and set down the dish . The first cat walked over took a little nibble and then went for the full chowdown . The second cat realized that she was missing out , pushed the older cat out of the way and set about to power eating . 2 happy cats over here . <br /> <br /> Happy human notes : no BIG fishy smell , no strange looking formed bits , just some good looking , healthy cat food .
