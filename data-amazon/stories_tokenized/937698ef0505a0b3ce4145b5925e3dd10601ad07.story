We bought this with the hope of preventing cats from getting out . They are smart enough to bait the dog to come near the door and let them out or in as they wish . <br /> <br /> I think this door is overpriced . It does not come with a battery or charger , and you really need 2 batteries so you can charge one while using the other . We installed it into a door , so using the ac power cord is not a good option . Also , our puppy chewed through the wire connecting our computer to the Internet the first week we got him , making us nervous about a power cord in his space . <br /> <br /> We got a 2nd puppy . A few days later we found the cover of his collar transmitter in the yard . I guess the two dogs played too roughly and the transmitter came apart ? The button battery from the inside was missing , and it was 5:30 pm . We looked in the grass for it til it got dark but never found it . Swallowing a button battery is a medical emergency , kind of like appendicitis , only it can affect any part of the GI tract . So we had to take both dogs to the emergency vet to get x-rayed to see if either had eaten the battery . No battery in either dog , thank goodness , but we spent a bit more than $ 250 for that information . The collar transmitter should have a screw or something to hold it together better . <br /> <br /> I am currently writing this from my bedroom , and I hear the door opening and closing over and over . A dog must be sitting too close . Guess that means we will be charging the battery again in the am . I 'm annoyed by the sound , though it is not horribly loud . I really wish we had gone with a heavy duty magnetic type door .
