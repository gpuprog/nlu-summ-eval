I have the CatIt fountain with the blue plastic which is pictured , which is why I bought it , but I received the package with the green plastic CatIt fountain on the cover with a different serial number . After opening the package and inspecting the filters I see that they are basically the same thing and will also work with my fountain . So if you are like me and have the blue plastic fountain , do n't sweat it , if you get the package with the green plastic fountain on the front they still work .
