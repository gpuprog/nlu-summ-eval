Strong coffee is enjoyable to me , but Tully 's Decaf French Roast has an acrid , burnt taste that I do n't enjoy . I can choke it down by adding lots of creamer . Timothy 's Rainforest Expresso Decaf makes a strong cup with a smoother taste . I understand that the French Roasts have a stronger taste . I 've used Starbucks French Roast in the past in my drip coffee maker and was pleased with it . This variety is almost undrinkable !
