Earl Grey was one of my favorite flavors before I got into loose leaf tea and I still come back to it on a regular basis . The comforting aroma of bergamot the it 's flavor mixed with black tea is hard to beat . Of the many brands of Earl Grey I 've tried over the years , H&B 's is without a doubt one of the better ones . <br /> <br /> It rises above an average tea bag in that it can produce a well balanced cup over at least two steepings . Just brew it for a shorter time than recommended on the packaging . For me it is under 2 minutes for the first cup and longer for the second . It mixes well with cream and sugar too , though I prefer mine black . Another plus is it 's ability to taste good as a cold tea as well as a hot one . The citrusy bergamot flavor is prominent in this mix so perhaps that is its secret . <br /> <br /> In any event , quality tea leaves and flavorings are evident here and I would purchase it again . There are better loose leaf tea blends available , but as a bagged tea it is hard to beat . <br /> <br /> ~ Kort
