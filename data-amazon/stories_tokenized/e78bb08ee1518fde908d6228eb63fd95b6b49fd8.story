This tea has an authentic green tea flavor , much like the Kirkland Signature Green Tea Matcha Blend 100 % Japanese Tea . Priced at $ .17 / bag , it does n't get much cheaper for tea with this kind of good flavor , but there is a $ 6 shipping charge through Amazon . The Kirkland tea is $ .20 / bag , but shipping is free . Although the bags are in lined pouches , they are also packed in sets of 10 bags , so you can grab a set to go if you want to . I recommend this tea .
