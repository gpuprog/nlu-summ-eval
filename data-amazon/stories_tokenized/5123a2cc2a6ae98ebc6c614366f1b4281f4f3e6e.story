I do n't expect my breakfast cereal to be sugary . I did n't grow up eating Sugary Sugar-sugars for breakfast and , frankly , very sweet cereals have little appeal to me . Even so , this cereal is pretty disgusting . <br /> <br /> I bought it because I wanted to include more fiber in my diet , to keep things running a little smoother , if you know what I mean . I 've bought a couple other fiber cereals lately , but I happened to be at a grocery store that carried this one -- which I had n't seen before -- so I decided to try it out . <br /> <br /> I do like the short ingredient list ; that 's great . However , this cereal has so little flavor that it is almost inedible . I have eaten it with berries a couple times , and that really improves the flavor . On the box it calls the shapes `` Crunchy O 's '' , and the picture makes the cereal look like long , grainy Cheerios . The actual product does not look like that . The actual product looks like little logs . It looks like hamster food , so that is what my husband and I call it . -LRB- `` I 'm going to have some hamster food . Want some ? '' or `` I 'm ready for breakfast . Do you want me to grab your hamster food ? '' -RRB- <br /> <br /> One other thing is , I would n't really expect this cereal to be delicious , but the box is pretty misleading about that . On the back of the box it calls it `` tasty '' -- twice ! It also says the cereal `` is the healthiest , most effective and enjoyable Fiber cereal you can buy . '' Healthiest ? Maybe . Effective , eh , okay . Enjoyable ? Nope ; I have to draw the line there . And then , the back of the box has a series of testimonials including : `` It 's the best '' and it `` tastes terrific . '' Terrific ? Really ? What does that guy usually eat ? <br /> <br /> So , if you 're in the market for a fiber cereal and you absolutely can not possibly tolerate a gram of sugar or some salt , this is probably the stuff for you . I do n't know whether they used food-grade inks to print the box , but if so , you can eat the box once you finish the cereal . <br /> <br /> If you would like a high fiber cereal that also has some flavor , try another brand . I think the other one I was eating had 11g of fiber instead of 14g , but my point is that there are great alternatives out there . <br /> <br /> Or , plan to eat this with some fresh berries like the picture shows . Since the cereal itself has so little flavor , the berries make a big difference .
