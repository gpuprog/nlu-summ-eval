I live in New York where you 'd think Mexican hot sauces would n't be readily available . And while it 's true that Tabasco Chipotle Hot Sauce is easier to find than this brand , like the original Tabasco sauce , the Tabasco chipotle has too much vinegar and not enough smoky pepper flavor for my taste buds . That 's why I always have a bottle of Cholula -LRB- or Tapa Tio -RRB- , which are red Mexican hot sauces , and a bottle of Bufalo Chipotle in my fridge . Bufalo 's smoky flavor is the best .

Love that Smoky Flavor
