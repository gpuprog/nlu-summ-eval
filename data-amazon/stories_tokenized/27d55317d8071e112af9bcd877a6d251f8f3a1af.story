Looking for low carb snacks without dairy or egg -LRB- which I am allergic to -RRB- , I thought this would be a great snack . It tasted awesome - but I read the label -LRB- my fault for not doing sooner -RRB- and saw it contains milk . Would get 5 stars if I could eat it . Ingredient list is missing from Amazon website , and that information would have been nice to know before I ordered . However , at least the guys in the house love the taste .

Tasty but why dairy ?
