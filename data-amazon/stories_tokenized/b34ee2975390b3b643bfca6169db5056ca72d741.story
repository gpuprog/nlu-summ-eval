I ordered two bags of Yummy Chummies and they arrived promptly . However they should have been shipped with a hammer enclosed to break them . We have purchased these before from Costco and they were moist , the ones we purchased online were hard as rocks . I believe they may have been a very old product and I was very unsatisfied with them even though the dogs ate them . I have no idea how you can verify a fresh product when ordered online .

Disappointed in this order
