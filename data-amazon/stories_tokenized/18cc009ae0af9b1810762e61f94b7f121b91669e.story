My family loves Divine brand chocolate . We recently discovered the Dark Chocolate with Ginger and Orange . It is wonderful . The ginger is not overpowering and the orange is nice and tart in contrast to the dark , smooth chocolate . <br /> <br /> I rate 4 stars because it does contain soy lecithin -LRB- non-GM -RRB- , darn it !
