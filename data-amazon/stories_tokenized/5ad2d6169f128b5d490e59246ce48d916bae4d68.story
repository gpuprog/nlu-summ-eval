I agree with one of the other reviewers . The language and pictures are vague . `` 3pk 6 inch '' and the picture shows multiple packs . You think you are getting three packs , each with three inside , so a total of nine . <br /> <br /> You only get ONE pack with three pieces - so $ 11.55 for only three thin six inch pieces ?!?!???!!! This is a super RIP OFF !!!! <br /> <br /> Also , the seller claims that the language is clear . Well , if there is any doubt , instead of trying to defend themselves , why do n't they just edit the words and pictures so that buyers know exactly what they are getting ? This is the simple answer .
