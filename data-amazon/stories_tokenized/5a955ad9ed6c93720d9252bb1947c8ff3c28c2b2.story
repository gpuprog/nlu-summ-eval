Shipping was horrible . They claimed they could n't keep it cool for delivery to NY in the summer -LRB- How come Godiva can ? -RRB- <br /> <br /> Chocolates good , but ... -LRB- others can be better-maybe these were just handled & shipped so poorly that they were no longer good -RRB- . <br /> <br /> Gave as gift , I think I can probably do better .
