I 've complained about the expiration dates when ordering from amzaon . This had the same problem . While the ingredients look decent , even though it has chicken meal , my dog was not thrilled with this food at all . She 's 9 yrs old and I thought the Glucosamine would be beneficial to her . So even though the dog food is going to expire in 4 months , I 've ended up having to give it away to someone else as she just looks at the food and back at me like `` Really you expect me to eat this '' I will say that she is a very picky eater . So it maybe great for others , just not for my dog .
