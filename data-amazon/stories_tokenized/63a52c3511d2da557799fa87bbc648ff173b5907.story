Red & black German raspberries are definitely one of my favorite candies . They have a clear chewy gelatinous center that is coated with crunchy red or black sugar spheres . They 're very sweet tasting , with a slight flavor of the berry they represent . The black ones are a bit less sweet than the red , with a barely noticeable hint of bitterness .
