I was a little unsure about purchasing this because of all the bad reviews . I then realized the product was very cheap in price and I kept telling myself `` You get what you pay for '' . After a few days of debating , I finally decided to purchase it , and I am so glad I did . It is very sweet and a little bitter , but what else would you expect from something that is caramel apple ? In my opinion , it has a nice rich flavor , without the artifical or chemical tastes .
