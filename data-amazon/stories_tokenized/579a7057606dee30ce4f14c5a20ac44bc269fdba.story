My cats just love the Friskies Pates and will not eat any of the textured ones , like shreds , except the tuna and egg which Amazon does not carry . I have six cats . They all share one can each morning for breakfast . The one can feeds them all with some left for seconds . They have their regular Friskies dry food out all the time in the gravity feeder , but they enjoy their breakfast Friskies pates . Wo n't go with another brand . I 'll stick with Friskies . Be sure to choose the 24 can case of one flavor pate for about $ 9 , not the one for about $ 18 . It is the same product and quantity , just a higher price . Also use the subscription to save more .
