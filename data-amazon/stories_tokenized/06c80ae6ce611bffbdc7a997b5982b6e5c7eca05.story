I brew espresso on great equipment at work . I normally use Peet 's Espresso Forte , which is better , but much more expensive . My bag had shiny , dark beans with a pleasant aroma . The espresso is n't as strong as I 'm used to , but is n't offensive . It will take me a while to use 2 pounds ; I expect that I 'll go back to buying 1/4 lb weekly instead .
