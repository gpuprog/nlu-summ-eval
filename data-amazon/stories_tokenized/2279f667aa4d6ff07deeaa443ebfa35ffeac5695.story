I picked this up at Target . Did n't pay anywhere near $ 25.00 for it . -LRB- Seriously ? For hot chocolate mix ? Who is setting these prices ?! -RRB- This makes the best hot chocolate I 've ever had even when I compare it making it from scratch and the family hot chocolate dry mix . -LRB- Do n't tell my mother I said that . -RRB- Highly recommend .
