This is n't horrible . I still drink it , but I am never going to buy it again . For starters , its WAY bitter . I normally like dark black/bold coffe , but this has a bitter finish that is not very appealing . <br /> <br /> I 've tried most of the k-cup coffee , and I think Caribou 's Blend coffee is probably my favorite . On the lighter end of the scale , the Coffee People 's Donut Shop coffee is also pretty good .
