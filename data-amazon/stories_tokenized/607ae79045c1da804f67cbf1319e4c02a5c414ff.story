The market for a package like this is infinitesimally small . Kids and nostalgic adults who like sticky , artificially fruity Dots . But for those that enjoy it , there is no better gift . I generally buy the larger 7.5 oz boxes in single portions . The problem is that once opened , it is too easy to eat a whole box in one shot . This package is meant to be single-serving . Less guilt . Less trouble . But the love keeps on coming day after day with a pack of 24 smaller boxes . This was on my Amazon wishlist for a while -- though not the most practical gift , it is one that made me smile when opened . Sometimes love does come in small boxes of cherry , lime , lemon , orange , and strawberry flavors .
