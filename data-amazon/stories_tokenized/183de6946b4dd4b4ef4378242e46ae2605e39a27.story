This bread actually tastes like ... bread ! That is a change after the other GF breads I 've tried . I 'm excited to try more from this line . Now , I 'll admit , the appearance of this bread is nothing like a loaf of french bread , but the texture actually is pretty close . I was a little doubtful it would taste that good due to the looks of it , but after a bite I decided that looks just are n't that important when it tastes like this !

Finally ... great GF bread !
