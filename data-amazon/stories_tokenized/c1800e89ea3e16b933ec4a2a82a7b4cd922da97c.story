This flavor of Hint water is not available locally -- I was thrilled to find it on Amazon . <br /> <br /> If I were wealthy this is the only water I would drink - it tastes exactly like what it is -- water with a Hint of watermelon . Simply delicious !!! <br /> <br /> Watermelon and Blackberry are my favorite Hint flavors .
