I 've been a Senseo fan for three years , and I subscribed to delivery through Amazon . Over the past year or so I 've felt the flavor fading , and with the ONE THIRD PRICE INCREASE over the last year I 'm rethinking my devotion . I just cancelled my subscription . We 'll see how I feel when the coffee runs out . Back to the french press ?
