I was so happy I tried these noodles ! Allergic to Gluten , Potato , Rice , and Corn , I thought pasta was out of the question . <br /> Following the package instructions for preparation , I did not find these to be rubbery as another review claimed . They do have a different texture than wheat , but still wonderful ! I had `` spaghetti and meatballs '' for the first time in years ! <br /> If you are buying these because of allergies , I think you will be happy . My 3yr old enjoyed them as well !
