OK ... I 'm biased . But I 've had the ` inside scoop ' so to speak , and it 's been great watching these two entrepreneurs work on their business and succeed . I 've tried all the flavors and decided that Cinnamon and Raisin is still my favorite . <aÂ href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008B80M8I"> PB - Cinnamon Raisin </a> Here 's a tip : sometimes the oil will rise up during shipping . I found that just stirring it up a bit and putting it in the Frig helps . It still spreads easily . Keep it up ladies !
