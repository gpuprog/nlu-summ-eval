Palmetto honey has a very unique flavor . It 's bold , but not bitter . Heavy , but not super rich . A strong flavor with fruity undertones . A very slight bite with a mild finish on the palate . <br /> <br /> Whoever says this is n't great honey , must not use it often . I replace sugar with honey in nearly all my baked goods , and this is the best to use by far . I 've used several , so when I say it 's the best . . I can say it with confidence based on experience . <br /> <br /> I will say that I prefer lighter citrus honey for toast . But , this honey is not for toast . It 's for cooking , and for that purpose there 's no comparison .
