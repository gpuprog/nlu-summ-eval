I have tried lots of different coffee brands this year , and this one , by far , is the best . Although I usually prefer a light roast , this medium roast is fantastic . I thought that Gevalia 's blends were very good , but compared to this , there 's nothing like Hawaiian Kona . The price is reasonable for Kona beans , and this brand really is exceptional . <br /> <br /> I drink it black , so it has to be good . There 's no attempt to hide the flavor of crappy beans by over-roasting . Or , even worse , adding `` flavorings '' to mask an inferior product . If you have already tried this product and you know that you enjoy it , try searching for the `` 5 Pack '' on Amazon . It 's a good cost savings to purchase in bulk , the discount for buying 5 packages is equivalent to getting 2 packages for free . <br /> <br /> This coffee is very fine quality . Recommended .
