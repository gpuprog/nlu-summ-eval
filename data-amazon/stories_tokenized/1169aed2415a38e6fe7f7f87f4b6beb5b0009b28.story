The price was right for 6 cans of General Foods International Vanilla Bean Latte Decaf . I should have realized there would have been a catch . The `` Best when used by date '' is December 05 , 2010 . I received them in the mail on Sept. 29 , 2010 . I thought I would have a fresh product to last me the winter . Maybe expiration dates can be added to food product listings .
