This is a great product , healthy , low sodium , great taste ... from the only manufacturer in the US which does not use cans lined with a Bisphenol A epoxy . <br /> None of the other `` Organic '' suppliers bother to use packaging without BPA <br /> Try their garbanzo beans and black beans as well !
