This tea is one of my favorites ! I purchased this tea to replace a tea I received for Christmas that was seasonal and no longer available . This tea is now my favorite ! It has a great mix of flavors with the Vanilla , Orange and Chocolate , yum ! Comes as a loose tea , I recommend using the T-Sac Size 2 and Finum Filter Stick , super easy to spoon tea into sack , stick rests across top of mug and allows bag to hang in cup . Enjoy !
