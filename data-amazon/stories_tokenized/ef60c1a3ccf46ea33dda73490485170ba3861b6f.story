This is the genuine stuff imported from Sweden . It 's one of the best known brands for jam and holds a high quality . You get what you expect . <br /> So , this is the proper stuff to get unless you live in Sweden . Only lazy swedes would buy this stuff , not because it is bad , but because a proper Swede will go out in to the forest , forced by parents or relatives to pick it on days when you just know you should have said no and stayed at home watching tv , to pick it themselves . They will then make enough jam to last a full year , almost for free -LRB- you do have to pay for the sugar -RRB- . <br /> <br /> According to my sisters boyfriend , Lingonberry jam is best served with everything !
