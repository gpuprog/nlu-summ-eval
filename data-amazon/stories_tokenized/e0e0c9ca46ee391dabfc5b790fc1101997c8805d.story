For those who have never tasted a creamy hazelnut/almond/chocolate praline , you must try this ! It 's Nutella times 100 !! Keep in mind it is very rich and creamy . Leonidas also has a Gianduja Emballee which is pure hazelnut/chocolate paste , which is to die for ! And for all those comments I see about Godiva comparisons , pah-lease ... it 's apples and oranges . Americans do not know that there is better chocolate out there . People - take a journey beyond Godiva and you 'll never go back . Promise ! :-RRB-
