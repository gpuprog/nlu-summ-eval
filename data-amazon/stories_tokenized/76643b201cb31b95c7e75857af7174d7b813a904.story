This is a great item to bring to a party or enjoy with friends on movie night . The mix of seeds and chocolate is just right -- slightly indulgent , but not a bag of candy . I bought it to share with family members who have dairy and nut allergies , but everyone dug right in , and went back for more . It 's a light mix , very flavorful , and just right for snacking or enjoying with a casual meal . Some people in our party even put it on top of their fruit salad . <br /> <br /> A few other reviewers mentioned splitting it up into six separate containers , and that 's what we did , even though we served one whole bag of it at once : we split it into six small glass dishes and let everyone dish his own with tablespoons . I think splitting it up does keep the mixture just right , without letting the heavier seeds settle to the bottom . <br /> <br /> A lot of trail mixes get stuck in your teeth , and I have to say , that was not a problem with this one . Whether allergies are in your life or not , I highly recommend this mix . <br /> <br /> I only wish it were organic . -LRB- Then I would give it five stars . -RRB-
