I got these for emergency food rations that will last for at least a year . I try at least one <br /> can of the products that I purchase and I must say that this stuff is nasty !! It tastes like <br /> the plastic lining in the can . Yea I 'll eat it if I 'm starving but not until then . Anyone else <br /> even remotely like this stuff ? I 'd be glad to send it back or give it to my daughter for her <br /> dogs .
