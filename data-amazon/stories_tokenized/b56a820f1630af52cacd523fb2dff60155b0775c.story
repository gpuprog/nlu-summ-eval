There are 2 design issues with this toy : 1 . in order for the rope to go back in , it needs to be PUSHED back in - this is difficult for a dog to accomplish without human help as it is not a stiff rope , but a flexible one . 2 . When the dog pulls on the rope , it lifts the bottle up into an upright position , and when it 's vertical the treats do n't come out . <br /> <br /> My dog quickly figured out that the best way for the toy to `` work '' was if I set it up and let him pull the rope out while I held the bottle horizontal . So my dreams of independent play have not yet been realized .
