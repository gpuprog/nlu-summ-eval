My daughter and I are not big meat eaters and are always looking for a dish that is hearty yet healthy . I 've tried many other types of Gnocchi and these are definitely one of our favorites . They cook up in no time and are oh so delicious with just a bit of olive oil and spices or with pasta sauce .
