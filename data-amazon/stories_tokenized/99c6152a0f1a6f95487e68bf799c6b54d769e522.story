I have just bought the book by Dr Ornish as well as the book by Dr Esselstyn . Watched forks over knives DVD , and especially loved the DVD called FAT , SICK & NEARLY DEAD ... Had a heart attack a year ago so really trying to clean up my act . I want to go the way of Dr Esselsyn but I keep back sliding since my health is not yet near any life & death situation . Yet , at age 62 I see why NOW is the time to change ! I never had any cholesterol issues either until AFTER they put me on Statins and other beta blockers etc. . It DOUBLED in 4 months . SO MUCH FOR Doctors and their medicine on MY old self ... <br /> <br /> I went back to my juicing and using my VitaMix and in the past 60 days lost over 40 pounds . My wife makes me Vegan wraps and this is where my TACO Bell `` treats come into the picture . I just add 6 -LRB- yes exactly 6 -RRB- DROPS to these wraps that each contain less than 90 calories . Along with a dinner salad , that is all I have for diner so the assorted Taco Bell sauces are my TREAT . Now they are not what most ANY doctor I have read would say is a good choice . But I am not using them as most would . I use them as an accent flavor enhancer to add some darn flavor to my very limited diet . And it works great ! I have now kept my weight off over 4 months and continue to lose a couple pounds per week since I went back to Cheerios & skim milk for breakfast along with my juicing part time . I -LRB- so far -RRB- like this and the Taco Bell Jalepno sauce the best . So I have to give this 4 full stars for how it helps ME ... If I used it as you are supposed to I would lower it to 2 stars as I do not feel it is a healthy choice . but used in moderation I can feel like I am eating that good old junk food and yet keeping my cholesterol down below 175 . How can I not love this stuff ?
