I am absolutely addicted to these pastries ! I was so upset when I could no longer buy them at our local grocery store . I was having to drive an hour to buy them until I discovered them on Amazon ! They 're less expensive on Amazon but you have to buy a larger quantity than you would normally buy at the grocery store . It does n't matter because they seem to stay fresh . I am a Weight Watcher 's member and these work out great for a quick low-cal breakfast .
