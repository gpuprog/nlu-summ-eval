I was first given a box of this Yellow Label from a co-worker who had traveled to China . I instantly fell in love with the smooth flavor . I found it in a Food Max in Stockton , Ca but then the store closed down . I have been on a search for the last two months because my loose leaf is almost gone also . I was brewing the tea for the staff in my office and they all love it , so when I ran out of tea bags they all wanted to know where I got the tea from . The flavor is so smooth that you almost do not need any type of sweetner at all . This should be made available in the states in at least one major grocery store . I am buying enough to share with my friends ...
