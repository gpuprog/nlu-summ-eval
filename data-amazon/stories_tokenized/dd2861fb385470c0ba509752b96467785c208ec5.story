This variety pack of Twinings tea has four flavors . The Lady Grey is my favorite , hands down . It makes delicious iced tea . It has a crisp , clean taste . The other three flavors are good also . <br /> <br /> I use only two bags to make a pitcher of iced tea and it 's strong enough with just the two bags . This tea can be found locally , but costs much more than the Amazon price . This is my second purchase of this item .
