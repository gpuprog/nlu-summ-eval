<aÂ href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015DA1HI"> Sugar-Free Jelly Belly 2.3 lb case </a> I want to warn you about the possibility of extreme diarrhea , NOT merely a `` laxative effect , '' from a 3.1 oz . bag of sugar free Jelly Bellys . It has been 4 hours since I ate them -LRB- yes , I know I should n't have eaten so many ! -RRB- and I am still in distress . This is not just a `` laxative effect '' ! Laxatives do n't usually keep you `` running '' until there is nothing left . I think that this could be a super-fast prep for a colonoscopy - it certainly is just as effective , if you get what I mean . I am just lucky that I was at home and not at work or traveling . The warning should be stronger to save someone who is truly medically compromised from the danger of dehydration or worse . I would hate to see a child or an elderly person go through what I am experiencing .
