I really like this cat grass . It 's attractive and the cats like it a lot . The only thing I would change would be less packaging . Each package contains a new planter bowl and divider . You could easily re use the previous bowl and divider and the refill could come with just the seeds and peat . To help protect the environment I think I will opt to get my own seeds and peat next time .
