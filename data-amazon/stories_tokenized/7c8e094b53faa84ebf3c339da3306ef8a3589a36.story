As much of a tea fanatic as I consider myself , I 'd never heard of guayasa before running into the Runa brand . Now that I have , I could see myself buying it over and over again ! It has a full-bodied flavor without the bitter aftertaste of some black teas . It 's earthy without being heavy-handed or overpowering , completely unique from any other tea I 've tasted . You wo n't find tea like this anywhere else . And though the product speaks for itself , the business model of this brand does n't hurt : Runa buys guayusa directly from local farmers in Ecuador at fair-trade prices . Try it ! It 's worth every cent :-RRB-
