Pros : Super delicious , great to have for non-coffee drinkers , tastes like apple pie w / ice cream if you add a little french vanilla creamer -- yum , smells awesome while `` brewing '' <br /> <br /> Cons : A dollar each ? Really ? And when I purchased mine from Amazon -LRB- because I could n't find them anywhere in town -RRB- , they were about $ 30 for 24 k-cups -LRB- currently , they 're at $ 24/24 -RRB- . Compared to your other non-coffee options , the per-cup cost of these gems is just silly . I realize they 're a novelty , and apparently not carried in any retail store anywhere in North Texas -- but I ca n't make a habit of dropping thirty bucks on novelty beverages ...
