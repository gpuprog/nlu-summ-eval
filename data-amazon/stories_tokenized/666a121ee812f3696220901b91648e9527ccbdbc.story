One of the best , if not THE best iced tea I ever had , was served at a little cafe beside a golf course in Arizona . I asked the cook/waitress what type of tea they used , and she told me Farmer Brothers brand out of Flagstaff . So I ordered a box of the Farmer Brothers Black Tea bags . Each tea bag they say makes a gallon of iced tea . She had a special machine to brew hers in , but I just use a large saucepan , pour hot water in it , and put the lid on it and let it steep for five minutes or so . When making mine , I use only three quarts of boiling water . I guess the difference in the amount of water it takes is the machine , which I priced , and they started at $ 500.00 . However , you can still make the same great tea using just a little less water .
