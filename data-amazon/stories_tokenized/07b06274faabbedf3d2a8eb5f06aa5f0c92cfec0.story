I have only given this product 3 stars because I do n't understand how to use it . I am sure that if I were more used to having ` clotted cream ' I would give it 5 stars for flavor . It 's consistency is hard and not really spreadable . However I have n't yet tried it over warm scones which are probably the base for a 5 star review .
