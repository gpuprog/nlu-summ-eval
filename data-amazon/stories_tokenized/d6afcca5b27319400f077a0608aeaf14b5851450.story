I decided to re-write my review in order to let you guys in on how my cat 's been doing on the Waruva cat food . <br /> <br /> We decided to try pretty much every flavor on here because I could n't find any really good specific reviews for anything other than one or two flavors , here 's how my cats liked the following : <br /> <br /> Paw Lickin Chicken - This is one of the favorites with both cats , although my male cat , Puppy , has a harder time eating it unless I put it on a flat plate , he ca n't seem to get it all while in the bowl . However , my female cat , Akira , has NO issues with it at all . <br /> <br /> Grandma 's Chicken Soup - An epic fail for Puppy . He hates it , and refuses to eat it . I do n't know if it 's because of how liquidy it is , or if there 's a smell he is n't so into ... but he hates it . Akira loves it and ca n't get enough ... not sure how helpful this is , but I can say that if your cat prefers to lick their food instead of biting at it , you probably wo n't have a lot of success with this one , because Puppy licks his food and Akira bites hers . <br /> <br /> Polynesian BBQ - my least favorite of all the waruva products . It smells really strongly of fish -LRB- yuck -RRB- and is congealed ... it 's like jello . I have to fork it out of the can and mash it up in order to get Puppy to eat this . <br /> <br /> Peking Duckin was an overall success with both cats <br /> <br /> The Eggs and Chicken - Puppy would not eat the peas but Akira would -LRB- although she had some diarrhea after this . . but I think the eggs may be the culprit -RRB- . <br /> <br /> Steak Frites - was hands down the favorite for both cats . It also contains pumpkin so I prefer to give it to Akira since she seems to have more issues with getting the runs . <br /> <br /> Those were the notable of the flavors our cats have tried . I hope this is somewhat helpful to you . Overall I recommend going with paw lickin chicken and steak frites .
