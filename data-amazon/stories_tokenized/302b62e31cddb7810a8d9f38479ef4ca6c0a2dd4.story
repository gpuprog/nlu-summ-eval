I 'm impressed by how much this actually looks and tastes like a real Latte when used with even just hot water -LRB- not milk ! -RRB- . Some complain about the lack of coffee , but if a Latte is what I think it is , its not heavy on coffee , its more of a steamed milk thing . <br /> <br /> I might be wrong about that , though . <br /> <br /> Either way , my favorite way of having this treat is to just stir it in with some fresh hot black coffee . Tastes great !
