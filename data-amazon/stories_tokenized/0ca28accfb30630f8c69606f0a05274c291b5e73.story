I am very pleased with these cookies . They are soft and chewy , which is how I like my cookies . And they are very tasty . If you have to eat gluten free , you know the challenge is to find ready made products that are not outright bad , or something you would only eat because you have no choice . Granted , they cost more than normal packaged cookies , as gluten free products usually do , but price aside , I can say I would eat these even if I did not have celiac . <br /> <br /> When buying from Amazon you have to buy more at a time than you would if going to an actual store , and sometimes expiration dates can be an issue . When I received these they had an expiration date good for 6 months , so I was happy with that . I think they will be gone in 2 weeks , but it is nice to know they are not near their expiration .
