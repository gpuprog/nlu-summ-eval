I ordered this coffee when Amazon had it on their Friday special because it was one of the few advertized as ` bold ' . I like a strong cup of coffee that 's not bitter . <br /> This one hits it . The taste is really nice with no bad after taste . <br /> I 've had my Keurig for about 2 years now and this coffee and Obsidian are my two favorites so far . Tully 's Italian Roast gets the top spot because it is less expensive . <br /> I will keep it on my list to not run out of .
