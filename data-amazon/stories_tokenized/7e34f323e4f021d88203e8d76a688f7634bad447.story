50 lbs . for $ 22.00 + free shipping is a pretty good deal these days . The nuggets are smaller & have different shapes which is good for my 3 small dogs . It smells beefy . I mix Moist & Meaty with it & they seem to like it so far . My 2 larger dogs like to take a mouthful from the bowl & bring it in the TV room & pick on it . That 's a good sign they wo n't be turning up their noses . I like the High Protein factor too . Even a couple of my cats have nibbled on it a bit because of the smaller mixed pieces .
