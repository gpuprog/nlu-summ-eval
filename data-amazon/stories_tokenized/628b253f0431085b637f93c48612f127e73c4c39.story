My dog is highly allergic , a picky eater and prone to dehydration . The quality of ingredients , moisture content and palatability of Natural Balance L.I.D. Sweet Potato and Fish has kept me a return customer even after trying more expensive fish-based grain-free canned foods . I now mix this in a 1:1 ratio with the Natural Balance L.I.D. Sweet Potato and Fish dry food and it has done wonders for my dog . She now ca n't wait to eat , no more itching/scratching , has a silkier coat and has a wetter nose -LRB- something the vet did n't think possible owing to some potential facial nerve damage -RRB- . In addition to all of the benefits , I also have to praise Natural Balance for keeping such as high quality food affordable . For less than $ 2 a 12-ounce can , I can have it shipped directly to my door in a few days .
