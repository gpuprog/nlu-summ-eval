I bought the smokehouse chicken breast strips because they were made in the U.S.A. . They are so hard , my dog can not chew them , and if I break them -LRB- which is hard to do -RRB- , I am afraid she will choke on them . There are not very many `` strips '' , mostly pieces . It is a wasted $ 22.99 , as I will not give them to her . How can you sell something so dangerous .
