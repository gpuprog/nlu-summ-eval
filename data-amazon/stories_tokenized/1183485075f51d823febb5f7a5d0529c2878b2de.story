I love greenies as a treat for my American Staffy . She has never gotten sick after eating these treats . They clean her teeth and keep her breath fresh . Unfortunately they are very expensive and even at a discounted price , at $ 1 + per treat , it is quite pricey . I may look at comporable brands that are less costly , since she eats any type of treat thrown her way . I am lucky that she is not picky .
