Add this product to 8 oz water and you get a flavored drink . It dissolves well , and does n't taste bad , but I ca n't say it tastes great either . <br /> <br /> I 've used a number of these types of products mostly to give some flavor to water more than to get any health benefit . <br /> <br /> There are lots of similar products available . Try a few different products and stick with what YOU like . Each product has some combination of `` special '' ingredients that are used to differentiate them from each other . I did n't think this product was anything special . <br /> <br /> If you want less expensive water favor , try Crystal Light On The Go , I liked the Lightly Lemon version . <br /> <br /> Some of these products flavor 8 oz , and some 16 oz - so when evaluating cost/benefit make sure you know how much water it flavors . Eboost flavors only 8 oz , but costs the same as some of the 16 oz products .
