These chicken treats are good -LRB- more like the Chinese variety -RRB- , but outrageously expensive -LRB- $ 10 for a 3.2 oz bag ! -RRB- and mostly very small pieces , so after one bag , no more . Going to keep looking for something not made in China . Somewhere , someone in the US should be able to make chicken jerky for dogs without charging an arm and two legs .

Good , but small pieces and the price !!
