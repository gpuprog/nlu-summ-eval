I enjoy fresh ground pepper , who would n't . This innoative product allows that . There are however , two very minor drawbacks , but not serious enough to keep me from buying this producct again . There is no way to adjust the grind for fine , or coarse . Lastly , it is very difficult to turn the grinder because it 's small , and I ca n't get a good grip on it .
