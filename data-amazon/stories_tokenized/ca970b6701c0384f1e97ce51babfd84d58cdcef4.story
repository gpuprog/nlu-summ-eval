I was just starting to think about healthy foods , granola , fiber etc , and I already tried the `` Cascadian Farms Maple Brown Sugar Granola Cereal , 17-Ounce Boxes -LRB- Pack of 5 -RRB- '' which is n't as healthy and great tasting as this !! If you know about Weight Watchers points , you 'll know what I 'm talking about next . I have one of those Weight Watcher cards from a few years back * ahem * and I calculated that 1 cup of this is only 2 points . -LRB- The granola cereal was 3/4 cup for 4 points -RRB- <br /> <br /> I did n't think they could make such a good cereal with such low points ! It 's those 9 grams of fiber ! I love it ! <br /> <br /> FYI - I paid $ 6.72 -LRB- with subscribe and save -RRB- for a box of 4 . I like to post what I paid to help others in their decision at the time of purchase since prices change so frequently here . <br /> <br /> HAPPY EATING !
