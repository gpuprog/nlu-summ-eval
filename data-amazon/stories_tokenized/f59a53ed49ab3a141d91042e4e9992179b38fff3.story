I have recently discovered dirty martinis . My brother in law is the culprit of leading me astray while away on a cruise . I was later up in Upstate NY and purchased some onions to go along with my latest vice when I noticed they were not salty but very tasty ! I am a person who loves sweet things espcially if they are pickled . These were the perfect match for me . Since then , my wife and I have been trying to lose weight . Yes , we are watching our fat intake but have discovered it is the salt added to everything that is killing us all . Look at a regular pearl onion and how much salt is in them , it will blow you away . Oh , and the olives , too . Compare that to these new Tipsy Onions and you 'll do what I am doing ... One Olive and three Tipsys make a wonderful Martini !!!
