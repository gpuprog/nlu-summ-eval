This is the first coffee I tried when I got my Keurig . I was so disappointed in the flavor ; tasted like plastic -LRB- like drinking bottled water that was left in a hot car -RRB- . I thought maybe I had n't cleaned the Keurig enough so I put through more water and brewed another cup ... same horrible taste . I would not recommend this brand to anyone .
