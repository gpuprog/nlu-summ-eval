This is my second bag of pistachios and there 's some wonderfully bad surprises in this batch . I had the fortune to sample the flavors of shoe , shampoo , ham , and frozen pizza in this bag . It did n't help that the pistachios had several impossible small butt cracks to try to open . Just to clarify the first bag I purchased was great , but there 's something wrong with quality control if I 'm tasting feet in my bag of pistachios .
