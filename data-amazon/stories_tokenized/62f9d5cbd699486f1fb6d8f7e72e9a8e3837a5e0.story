At the current price of $ 42.99 , this costs much more than any retail store that I 've ever seen this in for about $ 3.58 per bottle . The highest price I 've seen this bottle for is $ 2.99 although I 'm sure it may be available for more in a marked up retail store . -LRB- From my experience though , these stores usually sell only the smaller sizes . -RRB- I regular shop for and purchase this bottle -LRB- separately and not in a case -RRB- at about $ 2.00 to $ 2.25 each on average . What gives ?

Why is it so expensive ?
