I 'm not sure it is so great that I bought Coconut Palm Sugar . Since then , my weight has begun CLIMBING ! I listened to Dr Oz but I 'm wondering whether he just talks us into something then lets us buy it and `` leaves . '' I have n't changed but I can not get my weight down . Anybody have comments ?
