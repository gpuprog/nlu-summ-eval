My baby likes the mac n cheese in the jars . So , when I could n't find the jars at the store I was at , I tried these mac n cheeses thinking they were the same . They are not . She does n't like these . Maybe it is a texture issue mainly as these are much runnier than the jar kind . Looking for more mac n cheese jars .
