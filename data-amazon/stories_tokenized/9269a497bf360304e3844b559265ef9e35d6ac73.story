I was disappointed with the taste of these chips -LRB- regular and barbecue -RRB- . I ca n't really taste the potato , so it is almost like eating a badly-flavored foam chip . It tastes like it is stale even though it is fresh , and it also has an odd chemical-like taste . The similar baked lays and pringles chips are very tasty . My kids finally ate the rest of these chips , but only after all of the other chips were gone .

They have a strange taste . Much worse than baked Lays or Pringles .
