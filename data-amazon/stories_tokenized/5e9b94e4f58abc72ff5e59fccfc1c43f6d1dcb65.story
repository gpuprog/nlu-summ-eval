I have tried one of the four jams in this collection -LRB- Black Raspberry -RRB- . And it is one of if not the best tasting Jam ever . The quality of the Jam is very very high . Most jams/preserves you buy in the grocery store are one solid mass when you open the lid . Not these jams , very smooth spreading , and the taste . mmmmmmmmmm After writing this I think I am going to go have a PBJ sandwitch .
