First off , the ingredient list of this baby food -LRB- Organic pear , organic broccoli , organic spinach , ascorbic acid , organic lemon juice concentrate -RRB- earns no complaints from me . Obviously , use your discretion about when to introduce these foods , and how they fit into your baby 's complete diet . I personally wait until at least 8 months to introduce broccoli and spinach , since they can be a bit harder to digest than some others . But certainly a blend of organic fruit and veggies has a good place in a baby 's menu . <br /> <br /> The packaging is also nice in my opinion : it 's portable , convenient , resealable and BPA free . I make most of my own baby food , but this would be highly convenient if I 'm on the go . A parent could even squeeze directly into a spoon for feeding if you did n't want to tote and clean a bowl . If leftover portions have n't been in contact with a dirty spoon , you can reseal and refrigerate for a day or so . <br /> <br /> My only other criteria for evaluation is taste preference . Obviously this is going to vary from child to child , but I offered this to several young guests in our home and the consensus seemed to be that babies liked it , but toddlers did n't . I realize this is baby food , so that makes sense , but I 'd hoped my toddler would also enjoy it . Squeeze pouches of blended fruit are usually popular with that age , a convenient snack , and this particular blend would have been wonderful for relieving occasional `` regularity issues . '' Alas , several toddlers turned this down , even though mine does like all these ingredients separately . It was a hit with a 12-month-old guest , however . <br /> <br /> All in all , this seems to be a solid choice if you 're looking for a fruit/veggie baby food in a convenient , packable container . It does make sense to buy a smaller amount first if you can to be certain that your child likes these flavors together .
