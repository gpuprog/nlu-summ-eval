Wonderful taste and very helpful for my daughter who has a long list of food allergies . Comforting to know that she can eat this and not have problems afterwards . Extremely healthy . We have also used it as a substitute for some recipes that call for barley . <brÂ /> Thanks to Bob 's Red Mill gluten free products .
