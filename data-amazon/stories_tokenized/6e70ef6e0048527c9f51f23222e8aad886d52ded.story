I am a huge fan of ginger snaps . When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free , and recently pregnant , I 've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps . I 've tried three : <br /> <br /> Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps <br /> Annie 's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies <br /> Mary 's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps <br /> <br /> 1 . Mi-Del <br /> Texture : a bit grainy . Crunchy , but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture <br /> Ginger flavor : middling , a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much <br /> Sweetness : sweet , like you 'd expect a cookie to be <br /> Size : about 2 inches , and about 1/4 inch thick <br /> Density : the most heavy or dense of the three <br /> Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars <br /> <br /> 2 . Annie 's <br /> Texture : a bit grainy , but less so than Mi-Del . Very crunchy . Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking . <br /> Ginger flavor : the most mild of the three , has that gingery hint to it , but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue <br /> Sweetness : mild , less sweet than Mi-Del . More like eating an animal cracker than cookie . Tastes great with a slice of cheese . <br /> Size : about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch , and very thin <br /> Density : light <br /> Overall 4 out of 5 stars . If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack , this would be 5 of 5 stars <br /> <br /> 3 . Mary 's <br /> Texture : VERY crunchy , not at all grainy . Texture was the least `` gluten-free '' like of the three . Felt like I was eating a regular cookie . <br /> Ginger flavor : very spicy . I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break -LRB- but I 'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side -RRB- . I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though . Plus , it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus . <br /> Sweetness : not as sweet as Mi-Del , but not as mild as Annie 's . very pleasant to me . <br /> Size : about 2 inches , and about 1/4 inch thick , basically the same as Mi-Del . <br /> Density : Ultra light , most airy in the center <br /> Overall 5 out of 5 stars . <br /> <br /> Everyone 's tastebuds are different , but these were my perceptions . I personally want a ginger cookie with a good `` bite '' to it , and I really ca n't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture -LRB- which seems to be most of them -RRB- . I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item . For me , Mary 's fit the bill exactly , and Annie 's was a close second . Annie 's was so different though , I 'd eat Mary 's as a cookie , and Annie 's as a snack , so I could see having them both in the pantry . <br /> <br /> The one I still want to try is Pamela 's , because it has great Amazon reviews . I just do n't want to buy them in bulk until I try them , so I need to find them locally .

Ginger snaps are okay but I 've had better .
