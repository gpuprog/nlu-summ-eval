Kind Bars are a wonderful snack for those who are interested in protein and longer-lasting energy . I love Kind bars , because I do n't get a carb energy drop after eating one , thanks to the low sugar & high protein/fiber content . When I know it 's going to be a long afternoon , I grab a Kind bar . <br /> <br /> The Madagascar Vanilla Almond has a very good vanilla flavor without being heavily sweet , thanks to having only 4 grams of sugar . You can see all the little black vanilla beans in the bar ! This means they used real vanilla -LRB- as stated in the ingredients -RRB- , and no artificial flavorings . <br /> <br /> Lots of satisfying crunching & chewing means I feel like I had a snack of substance . Kind bars definitely fit this criteria . There 's also some crisp rice mixed in for extra texture . There are a few too many peanuts and cashews in this variety for my tastes , would have preferred more almonds , but it 's not a turn-off . <br /> <br /> The calorie count is a bit higher than I 'd usually go for in a snack - 210 calories per bar - thanks to being mostly all nuts . But it 's still worth it to me , for the benefits of the protein . <br /> <br /> My favorite flavor is still the Kind Apple Cinnamon & Pecan variety , which I have on Subscribe & Save , but this Madagascar Vanilla Almond is a great runner up choice . <br /> <br /> Granola bars are overdone , mostly carbs , and just plain not so great for you -LRB- depending on the brand -RRB- . If you want a better snack , stock up on Kind Bars .
