This product did n't provide any extra moisture benefits that I could see or any extra nourishment . The nourishment I think I would have to use for a longer period of time to see the benefit if any . It contains Nutrium 10 but I have n't been able to find out exactly what that is . Dove mentions Nutrium in some of their body washes but does n't mention exactly what nutrium means . <brÂ /> The product has a nice light fragrance , so you do n't have to worry about any heavy or `` chemically '' smells in your hair . I liked the sheen that I got from using it but I ca n't say that it is a sheen that I ca n't get from using my other hair products . The moisture was n't any longer lasting than any other product that I use.This product can be used on natural or relaxed hair and does contain shea butter . The first ingrediet is Petrolatum , second is mineral oil , followed by paraffin then lanolin wax . I try to avoid these ingredients but I did want to try the product out . There are some good oils -LRB- sunflower seed oil , weet almond and coconut oil , etc -RRB- listed as well . The jar comes in a 6.7 oz size so you get a lot of product . Overall a light moisutre balm that provides good sheen .
