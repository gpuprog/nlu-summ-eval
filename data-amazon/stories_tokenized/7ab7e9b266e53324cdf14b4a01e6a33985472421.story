These are one my favorite kind of Sun Chips . They have a zesty taste that is not too sharp or bland , with just the right `` kick '' , and a nice crisp texture . While these are not a health food , their sodium and fat content is much better than other snack foods . These chips work really well with a dip and vegetables for a pre-dinner snack . <br /> <br /> Shop for price . The price printed on the 10.5 oz bag that I buy at my local supermarket is $ 3.79 -LRB- and I pay less on sale -RRB- , so the price on Amazon is higher than the manufacturer 's suggested retail price .
