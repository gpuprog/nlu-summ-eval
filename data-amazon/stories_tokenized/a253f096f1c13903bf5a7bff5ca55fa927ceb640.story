I loved this matcha ! <br /> It foamed up delightfully as I whisked it . I think that the foam and creamy texture is my favorite part of matcha . My first sip was delightful . I was met with strong green tea flavor followed by a hint of citrus and a bunch of creamy smoothness . It felt like I was drinking a latte ! While it was n't the vanilla I was expecting , the creaminess made up for it completely ! I am super happy I bought the large one ! <br /> I really enjoyed this cup of matcha !! I ca n't wait to prepare more !
