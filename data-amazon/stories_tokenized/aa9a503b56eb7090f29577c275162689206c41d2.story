I do n't usually like protein drinks , but this is a great idea - the coffee flavor gets rid of any flavor from the protein . It 's only 2 Weight Watcher 's points . I put it in a plastic cup and use the hand blender to whip it up , then add ice , and it 's a nice , happy pick me up in the morning . I am not good about sitting down for breakfast ; at least this way I get a good dose of protein and caffeine first thing in the morning !
