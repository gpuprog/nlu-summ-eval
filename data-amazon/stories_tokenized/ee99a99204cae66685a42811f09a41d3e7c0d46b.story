The product Carmel Corn Cobs is wonderful . <br /> The service at Amazon STINKS !!!!! <br /> I pushed the one day service button just to see how much <br /> it would cost before ordering any other ways , and <br /> before I knew it , Amazon had charged me $ 55.00 for a <br /> $ 20.00 box of Popcorn . They offered no way to correct <br /> my order , they offered no way to delete it , they just <br /> took my money and ran !!!!!
