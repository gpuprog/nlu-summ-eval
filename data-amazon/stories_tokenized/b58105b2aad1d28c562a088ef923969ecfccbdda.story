now these obviously are n't as flavorful as fresh young coconuts but vitacoco 's flavor is the best among the coconut waters on the market -LRB- zico & o.n.e. just do n't compare -RRB- and it contains more electrolytes . you really feel the difference when you hydrate with this rather than water or other sports drinks & it 's great to stock up on in preparation for those mornings when you wake up under the weather . my only gripe would be that the container is less travel-friendly because the lid is n't particularly secure , but as long as you 're not throwing your bag around , you should n't have an issue .

no better way to hydrate
