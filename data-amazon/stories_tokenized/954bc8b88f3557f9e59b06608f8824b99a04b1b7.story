The saltiness depends on how you prepare it . When you pour the salt in with the oil and kernels and then pop the corn you can use the whole salt thing and it wo n't be salty at all . If you only cook the kernels in the oil without the salt and then sprinkle the salt on to the popped corn last , it will be immensely salty . -LRB- I prefer the immensely salty style -RRB- . I really like this popcorn , I make it in a whirly-pop . It always comes out perfect every time . I like to add even more buttery-oil-goodness after popping -LRB- I like Kernel Seasons popcorn oil -RRB- to make it just like movie theater style . This popcorn is a million times better than prepackaged microwave popcorn , the two are not even in the same league .
