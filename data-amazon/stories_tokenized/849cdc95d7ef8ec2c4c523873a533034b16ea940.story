I am very picky about the tea I drink my favorite being Ahmad English # 1 . After trying this tea , to my surprise and delight I may have found another favorite ! <br /> <br /> This tea is very smooth with low acidity and it goes a long way . This is a loose tea and it brews up wonderfully in the Bodum double wall infuser cup . You can make several cups of tea with just a heaping teaspoon of this loose tea and each cup tastes great without being weak . <br /> <br /> The lemony bergomot is a lovely subtle addition that tastes and smells wonderful . The tea has a beautiful dark amber color and a full rounded flavor without the acidic bite some tea can have . <br /> <br /> At first the price seemed a bit high but after using it and seeing how little you actually need to use I would recommend this highly as a great value and consider it for gift giving . Then again once you try it you may not want to give it away . Very enjoyable tea !
