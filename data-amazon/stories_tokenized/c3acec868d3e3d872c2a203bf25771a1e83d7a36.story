The Pink Lemonaid flavor is good , but not great and I tire of it quickly . I will not be buying it again . I noticed that it adopts a sourness when I leave it out -LRB- mixed in water -RRB- overnight . Yuck ! <br /> <br /> It 's good every once in a while when you want a different flavor , but I would n't want to keep it in bulk .
