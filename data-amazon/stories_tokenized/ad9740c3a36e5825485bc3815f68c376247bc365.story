I purchased this for beer making . I read the other reviewer 's warning but this was the cheapest barley I could find online . The closest place that sales barley is 100 miles away . <br /> <br /> These are guesses . I 'd say only 5 % sprouted the 3/4 the length of the actual barley grain . 75 % sprouted but did n't make it past 1/4 the length of the grain . The rest did n't do a thing . <br /> <br /> There goes $ 40 down the drain . Barley is normally priced at about $ 12 for a 50 pound bag .
