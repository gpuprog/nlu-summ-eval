These multis taste really good , sweet and sour citrus . The reason I gave them four stars is that the dose is 4 , making them a bit expensive . Because of that , I wont be buying them again . I love Nordic Naturals and think their omegas are some of the best out there , so Im willing to pay the premium for those , but not a for a kids multi , when there are so many more to choose from .
