I love these 6 packs . I have three kids and I can easily make a snack bag for school with 2 each . And the benefit is there is not a bag left behind for mom and dad to graze on from the cookie jar . Great packagign for hiding in spots around house so the snack hungry teens do not eat them all in a day .

great for keeping family fingers out of the cookie jar
