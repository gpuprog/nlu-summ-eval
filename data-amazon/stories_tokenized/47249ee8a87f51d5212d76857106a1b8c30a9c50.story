I am the setup person in my church , for morning coffee and other things between Church service and sunday school . I used to use powder creamers and liquid creamers . Since I went with the individual creamers there has been less waist and everyone is happy to have choice . I use eight different flavors . <br /> Thank you , <br /> Larry Harrington
