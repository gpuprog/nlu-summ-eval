I am a great fan of potato chips and of Thai food . I was so happy when Kettle Chips decided to meld two of my great loves together ! -LRB- What a concept ... -RRB- These chips are spicy enough , without burning a hole in your tongue . Also , they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming -LRB- careful ! -RRB- . Once in a while , this is a treat definitely worth indulging in .
