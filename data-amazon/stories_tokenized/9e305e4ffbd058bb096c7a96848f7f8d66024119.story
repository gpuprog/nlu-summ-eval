This English Breakfast tea from Higgins & Burke , is good : it 's basic , good tasting black tea -LRB- English Breakfast blend -RRB- and is tasty . I was n't blown away by the flavor , but it was good : I enjoyed the tea , it brewed up quickly in these nice tea bags -LRB- I recommend about one minute of brew time -RRB- , and then added a splash of cream : it was quite nice !
