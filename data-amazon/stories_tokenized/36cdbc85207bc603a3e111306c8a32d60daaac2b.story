I received the Dark Chocolate variety . It 's very filling -- half a bar satisfies hunger . However , it tastes moderately bad . <br /> The taste is somewhat like a cherry-flavored chocolate filling or mildly like cherry-flavored cough syrup . <br /> Eating one or two small bites a time is tolerable . Eating more than half a bar at a time is difficult because of the taste .
