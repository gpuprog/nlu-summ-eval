The salt had separated from the rice , or something weird happened to this product . The salt is just sitting on top and so the rice tastes wickedly terrible . Either the other folks here who enjoyed this product do n't know what sushi is supposed to taste like , or my shipment got ruined enroute to me . I wo n't order this ever again .
