Wow , I just had my first Larabar today after a long run , and I have been blown away . As of late my preference has been for protein bars , but I had picked up a Larabar a few months ago just because it looked interesting . <br /> <br /> I tried the `` banana cookie dough '' flavor , since I 'm a banana nut . Unwrapping the package was difficult , though I 've since found out that they have a multi-layer wrapper because there are no preservatives . Once open , I was confronted with a raw looking rectangle of brown with pale chunks in it . It looked moist and smelled phenomenal . The first bite made me think `` banana bread '' , and as I ate the rest of the bar I decided it was n't quite like banana bread , but closer to that than a `` cookie '' , in any case . The pale chunks were the # 1 ingredient - almonds . The # 2 and # 3 ingredients were dates and bananas , respectively . The # 4 ingredient was ... . nothing . There are only 3 ingredients . I actually flipped the wrapper over to see the continuation of the ingredients list before I realized that there was no more list ! <br /> <br /> These bars are a little expensive for a non-protein energy bar , but the taste is like nothing you would expect from a brown rectangular smashed together food thing . Its simply incredible , and now I have to go back and purchase the other flavors to try them out , too .
