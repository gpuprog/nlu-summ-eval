A marvelous crunchy treat , acceptable to even the most finicky toddler . Wonderful with salsa and sour cream , hot spinach and artichoke dip , and many more ways . If they used a different fat to cook them -LRB- the label currently says safflower and/or canola -RRB- they would be perfect . I love that they 're free of GMO but I 'd be even happier if they contained a healthy fat such as lard or coconut oil , or even olive or sunflower or grapeseed would be an improvement .
