This bar just tastes plain weird.<br />There. I said it.<br /><br />I love KIND PLUS bars in general...they are like candy but with nuts and other awesome things.<br /><br />The Mango one tasted like Mango and coconut - and entirely TOO SWEET. Almost sickeningly so. Won't be buying the mango one again.
