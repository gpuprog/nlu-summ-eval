Hubby got me a box of the chocolate, soft centers, for Christmas. Candy is good, FULL Pound of it, LARGE Pieces, extra thick, tastes great, shipped and arrived before Christmas! Only issue was, while it was wrapped in nice red paper (;which was at no additional charge by the way, or so  he said he didn't pay to have it gift wrapped, nor ask them to wrap it) they placed a white sticker on each end of the box that said, SEE's CANDIES, so he had to HIDE the box (men simply do NOT re-wrap by the way, LOL) until Christmas!
