I got this product because I was on the HCG diet and wanted a special treat for Valentine's Day. I was really hoping it would be good, but it wasn't.<br />This chocolate can be used in cooking I suppose, if you add some additional sweetener to it. It did not relieve my craving for chocolate. It is very bitter tasting. When I tasted a tiny bite, it was just a little bitter. The bar is divided up into blocks. When I put a block in my mouth, it was awful and I ended up spitting it out. It made me think of taking a spoonful of bitter cocoa and trying to eat it.<br />Also, you have to order such a large amount that it is a huge waste if you don't like it. They should sell individual bars so people can know if they like it before buying such a large quantity.
