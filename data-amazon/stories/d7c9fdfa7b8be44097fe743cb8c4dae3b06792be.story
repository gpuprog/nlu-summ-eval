Confit, (Websters) pronounced kon-fee  "a garnish made usually from fruit or vegetables that are cooked until tender in a seasoned liquid"<br /><br />This is really tasty!  We searched for it at the local grocery store, zip, nada, zilch.  Lots of internet recipes for how to make your own.  Too much bother.  It was required in a recipe we wanted to try, so we decided to have a jar shipped to us.  It made the dish really great.  Then I tried it on my next hamburger.  Wow, love it.  My wife said it made her tummy unhappy later, but her system generally has the same response to all onions.  So if you're OK with onions, you'll love the sweet onion confit.
