These Hot Fries are a little hotter than I would like, but for those of you who like their snacks spicy then you will like these for sure. The bags are big and full, you certainly get your dollar's worth with Andy Cap Hot Fries.<br /><br />My only real complaint is the amount of preservatives in this product. Lots of MSG.  If you have issues with MSG you will want to avoid these.  The added MSG might be why these are so tasty and why it is so hard to put the bag down once you've had a few.

Spicy and tasty, not very good for you though.
