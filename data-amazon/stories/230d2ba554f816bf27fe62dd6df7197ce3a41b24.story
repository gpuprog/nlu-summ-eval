Even though the picture shows "Gevalia" brand coffee discs, and even though that's what the product is called, it's actually Maxwell House Brand. The seller at least emailed me to let me know that (after of course the product was already on its way).<br /><br />The product itself isn't that great. The milk discs don't always work correctly and it doesn't taste nearly as good as most of the other Tassimo drinks.
