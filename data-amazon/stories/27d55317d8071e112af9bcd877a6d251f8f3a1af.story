Looking for low carb snacks without dairy or egg (which I am allergic to), I thought this would be a great snack.  It tasted awesome - but I read the label (my fault for not doing sooner) and saw it contains milk.  Would get 5 stars if I could eat it.  Ingredient list is missing from Amazon website, and that information would have been nice to know before I ordered.  However, at least the guys in the house love the taste.

Tasty but why dairy?
