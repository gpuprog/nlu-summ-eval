I tried the Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger and Lemon Beverage mix as a hot beverage and it was fine. It had a ginger and lemon aroma. I was just getting over a sore throat and the ginger drink made my throat feel better. It did not taste like a 73 calorie drink. To me it tasted a little weak, but I added milk to my cup and enjoyed a lovely cup of ginger and lemon. I would recommend this beverage to anyone who enjoys the mixture of ginger and lemon in a hot or cold drink.
