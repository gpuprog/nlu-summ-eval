I've purchased these at the local gasmart for years, then moved to an area of the country that doesn't carry them.  I missed them so much I got online to see if I could purchase some.  Guess what, they DO ship and it's the same as at the corner store was!<br /><br />Great flavor, not greasy nor blah, right amount of spices, etc.  I've never found a better product than this for a snack beef link.  Whenever I go back to where I live, guess what, first thing is pull into the gasmart I used and get a few!<br /><br />You can't go wrong, they are fantastic!
