So I have terrible anxiety and stress issues. My friends are always telling me I should smoke weed lol. However, I'm not a smoker and I'm a professional so that option isn't available to me. I decided to try some hemp products to see if they helped any.<br /><br />This hemp protein is a big NO from me. What I have been doing is adding it into my protein shakes. I add a scoop of protein and a scoop of the hemp, then blend it with milk in my Magic Bullet.<br /><br />The problem with this stuff in shakes is that it has the consistency of sand. Literally, it tastes like sand in your mouth. Also, immediately after I make a shake, I mean immediately, all the hemp sinks to the bottom. So I end up drinking the shake and by the time I'm done there's a quarter inch of hemp-sand at the bottom of my cup with very little ingested by me. I have to literally spoon it out or pour water in, shake it up, then drink it real quick.<br /><br />So this product was a waste for me. No way would I ever buy this again. It is terrible in shakes. Maybe if someone wanted to add it to their food or add it to something they are baking, like cookies or brownies, it could possibly work but it's of no use to me. Also, the first product I tried was hemp oil vitamins and they really gave me a boost in my spirits and with more energy. With this stuff, I feel I'm not getting any of the benefits like I did with the vitamins. This stuff was a waste of money for me. I will use this bag and that's it.<br /><br />Also, the packaging is terrible. After you cut open the bag, you basically have to put it into a container. I used a pitcher lol. They should at least make the bag resealable with with a zip-lock.<br /><br />If you want to try a great supplement form of hemp for health reasons, I would recommend these which worked immediately:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00119TL2W">Hemp Seed Oil 1000mg - 60 - Capsule</a>
