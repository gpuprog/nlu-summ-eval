In the years that I've had my cats, the Friskies Prime Filets are the ones that they seem to love the most. between the one being reviewed here "Meaty selections" to seafood selection they can't get enough. No other will do it seems. I like the 24 can box since it lasts longer and with Amazon Prime is cheaper. Subscribe and its even cheaper and i don't have to worry about finding a place when there isn't any cat food and the cat gives you a stare of "Where's my food"<br /><br />Bottom line, They seems to like it very much. I'm sure if they can rate it it would be 5 meows out of 5.
