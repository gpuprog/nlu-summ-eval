For a company who's name is "Food Should Taste Good," they certainly do a poor job of practicing what they preach. I bought a couple bags of their lime torilla chips, and wasn't the least bit impressed. Granted, I only bought them because they were so cheap, and that was only because they had been marked 75% off (after being mark 50% off, and 25% off before that). Suffice it to say, it seems that I wasn't the first person to discover their horrible taste, otherwise people would have been buying them more regularly, and the Base Exchange wouldn't have been getting so desperate to get rid of them.<br /><br />Even with a gob of Tostitos cheese dip, the taste of these chips is barely tolerable.
