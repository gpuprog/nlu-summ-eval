After ordering on line, we had a fast delivery, which was much appreciated. The Newman's Own Organic Cat foods I could not find in my local stores. My 19 year old cat is finicky and we had finally found a food with nutrition in that she would eat.  Thanks Amazon.com.<br />Vivian Slabaugh<br />Kingston, Tn.
