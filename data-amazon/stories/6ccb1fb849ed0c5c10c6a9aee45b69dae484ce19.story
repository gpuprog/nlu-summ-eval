Some reviewers have had poor luck with this product. However, I have been luckier. The wasabi taste is pretty evenly distributed--and, boy, does it make this healthy treat go to another level. If you don't like the heat of wasabi, obviously, stay away from this. But if you do, it comes through pretty well (at least for me).<br /><br />In nutritional terms, this represents a good source of protein. It is a l.ow carb dish; it also has no cholesterol (if the statistuics are accurate). Also, no trans-fat.<br /><br />Ingredients are simple: soybeans, sea salt, and wasabi powder.<br /><br />I like simply eating it out of the bag as a healthy snack.
