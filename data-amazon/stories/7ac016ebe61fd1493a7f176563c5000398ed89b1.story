I have loved Nature Valley Crunchy granola bars for many years. They taste great and are perfect for when hunger stricks and the next meal is still a couple hours away.<br />They satisfy hunger and get you some of the fiber you need each day. I love the texture and the large whole oats.<br />A great granola bar!
