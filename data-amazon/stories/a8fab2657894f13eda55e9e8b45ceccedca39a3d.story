I like the fact that the recipe provides alternative to some of the ingredients like sugar (replace with honey) and butter (replace with canola oil), which we did since we have moved into more consciousness in the ingredients we are consuming.  The honey option definately tastes better than cane sugar (our other alternative to white and refined sugar); otherwise, it was not that sweet and a bit gritty.<br /><br />I am just pleased to have a package ready that I only need to throw in a few addtional ingredients and I have cornready within 30 minutes.  The mixture made two very small loaf tins, which is enough for four-six people: nice portions.

quality of the product is great, but a bit gritty in finished product
