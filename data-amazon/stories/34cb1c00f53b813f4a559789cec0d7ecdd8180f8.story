These are the smaller, brisling sardines--several per can. The taste is quite good, not overly fishy. Despite having "No Salt Added," I can't imagine wanting sardines any saltier than these. Being salt-water fish, they do contain some salt (125 mg per can, or 5% of the recommended daily intake). Two ingredients are listed: brisling sardines and soy bean oil. If you enjoy sardines and want to reduce your salt intake, these are for you. Also, I disagree with a previous review claiming these are "dry." I highly recommend these.
