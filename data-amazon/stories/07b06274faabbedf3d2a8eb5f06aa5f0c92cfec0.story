I have only given this product 3 stars because I don't understand how to use it.  I am sure that if I were more used to having 'clotted cream' I would give it 5 stars for flavor.  It's consistency is hard and not really spreadable.  However I haven't yet tried it over warm scones which are probably the base for a 5 star review.
