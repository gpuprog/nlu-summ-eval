I made a purchase of a one penny world map on the seventh of december, 2011. I went through all the right processes. I got on my computer today, december 9th, 2011, and was shock to see that I am being shipped this product. I DIDNT ORDER THIS PRODUCT AT ALL. HOW DID AN ORDER FOR A WORLD MAP TURN INTO AN ORDER FOR BLADDER CONTROL TEA??? Ive been trying to get a manager to talk to me from amazon, they keep hanging up on me. I mailed the company, 911 health shop, and guess what??? no respose. I DID NOT ORDER THIS TEA!!!!!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!
