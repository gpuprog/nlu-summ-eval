I drink this tea at all different times--breakfast, lunch, and after dinner. The French Vanilla flavor is bold but smooth, and not at all syrupy tasting. No other brand of French Vanilla tea that I have tried equals it for taste. Sometimes I drink it with honey and milk, which is amazing.<br /><br />While I usually don't drink coffee with caffeine in the evening because it keeps me from falling asleep, not so with this tea.<br /><br />If you are looking for a truly delicious French Vanilla flavored tea, look no further. I buy this at my local supermarket, which usually has it in stock, for about the same price as on Amazon, so I don't need to buy six boxes at a time.
