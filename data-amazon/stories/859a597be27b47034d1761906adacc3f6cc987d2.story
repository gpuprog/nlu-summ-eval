These are my favorite sardines thus far, but they are expensive because of not being able to get free shipping.  They are meaty and flavorful without being overpoweringly fishy and firm in texture.  Easy open can was nice too, as it was easy to open it without splashing like the pop-tops.  The only thing other than shipping price that I didn't like was that there were too many large/obvious scales in some cans, which was a turnoff as far as texture and visual appeal.  Despite this, they are definitely my favorite so far.
