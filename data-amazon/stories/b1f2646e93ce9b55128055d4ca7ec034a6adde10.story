I tried this after trying (and loving) the Tea's Etc Organic Coconut-Almond add-on.  This is a very good tea. It's a little mild for my tastes, as I was expecting the tea and ginger to have bolder flavors. (I'm not astute enough about tea to know if this is a blend issue or a freshness issue. Given the strong aroma I suspect the former.) That said, I really do enjoy it and just find myself using a pinch more and letting it seep longer to achieved the desired outcome. The aroma is wonderful and I think this is a perfect afternoon tea. (Who doesn't feel more energized after getting a whiff of citrus?!). The fact that the flavor isn't overpowering also makes it a good choice for folks who want to ease into drinking green tea. I'll order this again, but it will be awhile.  These "small" 3-oz packages last an impressively long time even with daily consumption!<br /><br />Update 9//11/12:  I paid $8.62 for this item.  I see it's now selling for less than $2...
