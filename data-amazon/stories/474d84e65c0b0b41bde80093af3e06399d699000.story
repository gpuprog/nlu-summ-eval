This is one of our favorite gf products! We love making waffles,pancakes and cookies with this! No one can tell it is gluten free.<br />It uses almond flour and I think that is what keeps everything so moist. Alot of gluten free products are dry and do not hold together well. Not Pamela's! It has made my life simpler and is one of the besst products out there. I would not recommend it for bread unless it was a quick bread as it just doesn't have the texture and taste of bread. It is a little sweet. Pamela's is wonderful to meet 95% of your baking needs!
