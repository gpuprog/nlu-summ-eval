I was looking for a replacement for my morning biscotti, something a bit more nutritious.  After searching on Amazon and reading reviews of breakfast snacks,<br />I decided to try these bars.  I'd had a KIND bar once and sort of remembered it was good. Well, these are FANTASTIC!  At first bite, I realized there were chunks of sweet mango, the intense mango flavor hit my palate, and it tasted real, not at all artificial.  This was followed by a bit of cruncy coconut which just perfectly tempered the sweet mango.  The macadamia's added a stronger crunch with just a hint of honey.  So I tried the ultimate test:  I gave one to my co-worker (out of the package, a blind test). This person lives on junk food and considers Krispy Kreme one of the four major health groups!  She absolutely loved this bar and sat down and ordered some on her break!!  The ones from Amazon were received in two days, expiration date was Dec 2010 (ordered April). They are fresh and the price was great with subscribe and save.  Love that I am getting some extra calcium and vitamin D (and no, you can't taste whatever they put in to add that).  I'll be ordering these regularly through subscribe and save. I just have to make sure I don't eat them for snacks, just for breakfast, or I'll run out =)
