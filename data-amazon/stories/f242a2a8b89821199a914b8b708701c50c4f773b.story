This hot sauce is no joke.  I've loved spicy food since before I could walk, and can't remember ever eating anything half as potent as this sauce.  I put a couple of drops of this stuff in nearly everything I eat, not only is it incredibly hot, but it has a really nice flavor to it as well.  Just be careful, like the label warns, you can clean oil stains on your driveway w/ this stuff.
