The dogs are getting a bit older, and on fairly regular meds.  Was using peanut butter on bread to hide them, as even the chewables they weren't interested in chewing, and wrestling them to get the pills down just makes it an unpleasant experience.  With Pill Pockets they actually COME for their meds when they hear me open the bag!
