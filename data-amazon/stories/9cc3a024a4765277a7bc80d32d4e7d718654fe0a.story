My pug loves Grandma Lucy's Organic Pumpkin treats.  Pumpkin is an excellent source of fiber and is also helpful for dogs when stomach issues (trouble going to the bathroom) arise.  The treats are really small - literally, the same size as the picture on the bag.

Great for small dogs with allergies and stomach problems...
