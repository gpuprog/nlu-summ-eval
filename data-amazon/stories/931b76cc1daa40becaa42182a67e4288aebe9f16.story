I'm a busy mom with two jobs and a 6 month old. I want to make my own baby food but I really don't even have five extra minutes to do that. HappyBaby pouches are my go to! I started adding Apple Cherry to my daughters cereal because she didn't want to eat the rice cereal plain. Now she gobbles it up! I feel good that she is getting awesome organic fruit in her cereal that doesn't have added sugar or color and it only took me a few seconds to get it prepared for her.
