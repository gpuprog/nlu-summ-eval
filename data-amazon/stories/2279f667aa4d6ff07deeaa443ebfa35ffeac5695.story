I picked this up at Target. Didn't pay anywhere near $25.00 for it. (Seriously? For hot chocolate mix? Who is setting these prices?!) This makes the best hot chocolate I've ever had even when I compare it making it from scratch and the family hot chocolate dry mix. (Don't tell my mother I said that.) Highly recommend.
