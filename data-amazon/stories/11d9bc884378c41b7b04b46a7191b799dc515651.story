I really wanted to like these after reading all of the good reviews.  I am not a cheese snob.  I like Baked Lays with cheddar flavor.  But something in the flavor of these cheddar Popchips is not right.  The first bite is OK but then there is a bitter aftertaste.  Too bad.  Back to Lays!

Never tasted cheddar cheese like this!
