Buffalo Bills western cut big slab beef jerky is flat out the best beef jerky on Amazon, hands down. The sweet and spicy listed here is tangy and tasty and it's almost impossible to eat just one. Try all the flavors, you won't be disappointed. I've had every kind of jerky from all kinds of different producers, and Buffalo Bills Western Cut Big Slab is the best by far. I give it as gifts for Xmas and birthdays, its really that good.<br />The only problem you are likely to have with it is storage. Usually I eat the entire bag within a day or two, so storage isn't that much of an issue, but your mileage may differ. I either use a large zip lock bag, or re-use one of the round plastic containers from Buffalo Bills regular cut jerky. If you re-use a round container, you will need a sharp pair of scissors to cut the western cut big slabs to make them fit in the round container.<br />Bottom line on this one is; Buy it, you will only regret that you took so long to find it.
