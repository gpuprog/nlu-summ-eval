Okay, Okay, I can see your eyes rolling. Instant mashed potatoes?  Well, not everyone has the luxury of having the time (or skill believe it or not)to properly prepare mashed potatoes.  There are many things that are going on in our lives and having to make a side dish that takes more time and/or effort to prepare than your main course on a weekday evening just ain't gonna cut it.  The nasty instant (dehydrated) potato?, blasphemy you say!<br /><br />Well, I may not be totally crazy (although the jury is still is still out on this one) but there is at least one (the only one that I know of) that is pretty damn good and it is the Idahoan REAL Premium Mashed Potatoes that I used to buy at Costco long ago in 3.24lbs containers.  For what ever reason, Costco stopped carrying this product but may still may carry some of the Idahoan potato product line.<br /><br />In short, they taste pretty  darn good by themselves but I have been known to add in some sour cream in lieu of some of the milk, blend in some well-cooked cauliflower, cheese or even some bacon bits.  Just follow the directions.  It is that easy.  Also, instant mashed potatoes can also make a good gravy thickener if used in small quantities.<br /><br />I just ordered some from Amazon.com for $14.337 a box.  Remember, this box weighs more than 3 pounds and will last a long time and price per ounce you can't beat...and as a matter of fact, you can't even mash it.  lol<br /><br />I usually order more to get the Super Saver shipping discount.
