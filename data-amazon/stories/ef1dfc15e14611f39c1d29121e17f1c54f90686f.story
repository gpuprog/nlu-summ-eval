Been using Cytomax for 5 years now & have been very satisfied . . . until now.  Tried Accelerade 4 years ago, but whey, a dairy product in Accelerade, caused stomach cramping, which was why I preferred Cytomax.  Liked recent changes in formula, which made product more citrus tasting, less sweet, a common complaint among fellow cyclists who don't use Cytomax.  Well, that changed when the manufacturers decided to add ACS along with an amino acid peptide blend containing whey.  For whatever reason, the product is much more sweet than the prior formula, perhaps to offset the dairy flavor imparted by the whey.  Who knows?<br /><br />I'm considering trying something else and would encourage the manufacturer to go back to the previous formula.  As I result, I'm cancelling my Amazon order subscription, not to mention the CA sales tax now added to the cost of buying this product from Amazon.
