Love this salt!  I don't remember when or why I picked it up in the first place.  Initially I bought it at a local fancy kitchen store. When they closed I found a local grocery that carried it.  Well, it's no longer on the shelf there either, so now I am STOCKED with a package of 6 containers of my favorite salt courtesy of Amazon.  I'm not certain of the correct salt terminology, but to me this has a smooth, clean flavor.  Other salts now seem to have a big "bite" that seems harsh and overpowering on my food.  This salt enhances the food without saying "Hey! Look at me! Taste me! I'm SALT!"  Great on popcorn, eggs, anything.  I have used this for years, and now that I have several containers, I may just have to share with friends.  Arrived in perfect condition, though I understand others have not been as lucky.  Each container is large, with a "sprinkle/shake" hole, and a "pour" hole. I keep mine in an open container so I can grab a pinch anytime.  Highly recommend!

Never knew I could have a salt brand preference!
