I bought this product based on the reviews and price. However nowhere in the product description or reviews does it tell you how much your getting. I assumed for $14.95 + $6.76 Shipping ($21.71 total) that I was getting a gallon. Imagine my surprise when I found it was in my mail box. After I opened the box, I discovered that it was only 1 pint (16oz). This won't last a week around my family. It can make the best tasting popcorn in the world and it still will not be worth it! Take my advise and buy the gallon size at http://www.amazon.com/Paragon-Coconut-Popcorn-Popping-Gallon/dp/B002YLI9E2/ref=pd_cp_ba_1_im<br />It is only $6 more. SO DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS RIP-OFF!
