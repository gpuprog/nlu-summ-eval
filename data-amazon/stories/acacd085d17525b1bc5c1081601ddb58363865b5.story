My husband and I did an extensive taste test of hard-to-find boutique kettle chips along with some of the higher-end, supermarket-varieties and found Madhouse Munchies to be the absolute TOPS! Crunchy yet delicate with a fresh potato flavor (nothing "off-tasting") and the perfect amount of salty goodness, they were so yummy we bought them by the case and hoarded them for months. Do not pass these up - they are TOO GOOD!
