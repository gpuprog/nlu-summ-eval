Overall, I found this granola quite appealing. Seemed like more granola than clusters, or maybe the clusters all just settled to the bottom of the pouch? ;)<br /><br />Flavor's good. Quite crunchy. I like the fact it's got largely healthy-ish stuff in it. Oats, seeds, etc. Seem to recall it has a little of your typical vegetable oil. Not entirely sure why that's necessary, plenty of fats in the seeds & such. I'd kind of rather just have dextrose-based sugar for binding w/o the added fat in the oil or whatnot. I assume there's a way. But regardless, overall I thought it was quite nice. I'd give it a good thumbs up. Good for snacking on the go, or probably as topping for yogurt or ice cream. I suppose you could eat it like cereal, though you'd only get a couple bowls out of it. Maybe 2-3?

Tastes good! Perhaps a little high in fat, though it's mostly from seeds & nuts.
