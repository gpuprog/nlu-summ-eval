I give this 3 stars for the packaging.  Not too long ago I could buy this in a cardboard tub.  I use gelatin daily and I hate all the packaging.  The tub was perfect.  I would like to have a choice whether to buy this kind of overpackaging but alas I can't find any other gelatin to buy except a more expensive version as a supplement produced by the same company.

Wish I could buy it in a tub.
