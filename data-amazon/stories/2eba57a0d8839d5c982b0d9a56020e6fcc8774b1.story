I have a dog who barks a lot and we have been training him not to bark as much by using the "Quiet" command and giving him a treat every time he is quiet (first we conditioned him before he barked by saying "quiet and giving him a treat every time we said that word - now when we say that word he immediately stops whatever he is doing and looks for a treat).<br /><br />Treats we have used in the past were good but because they were dry, they weren't as stinky and didn't get his attention during one of his barking rants. These treats are soo stinky and my dog loves them!<br /><br />I love them because they are easy to break up into 10+ pieces for training since they are soft. Also, compared to most other snacks they are healthy with duck meat being the first ingredient. Although I wouldn't consider these treats to be the healthiest you can get, they are certainly not the unhealthiest. We use the duck flavor because my dog has diarrhea when he has chicken, beef, or salmon and these work well for him.
