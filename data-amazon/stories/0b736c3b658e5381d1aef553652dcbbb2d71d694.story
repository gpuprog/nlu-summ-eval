My Husband and I love the Gardeeto's Snack Mix, but never thought they had enough of the rye chips in it. So we buy just the rye chips and mix the 2 together. That makes a better  mix as far as we are concerned. We are not able to find just the rye chips locally so we went to Amazon. Great service from them at a very competitive price. Will buy them again when we run out.
