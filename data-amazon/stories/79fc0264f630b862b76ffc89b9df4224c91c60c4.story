My local grocers quit carrying this product AFTER I had already developed an affinity for it. It's quick, easy, tasty, and if you put it together with a package of ramen noodles you have a meal in a snap! I work a lot of hours and I greatly value resources that put a meal in front of me with a minimum of hassle and adequate value. This hits the spot! Thanks Kikkoman, thanks Amazon!
