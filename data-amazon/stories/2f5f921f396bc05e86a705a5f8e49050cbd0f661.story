I chose these tomatoes because they are labeled "organic."  Since then I've discovered Muir Glen's cans contain BPA (in the lining).<br /><br />Because research shows solid levels of this chemical leeching from cans and plastics into containers' contents, showing up in Americans' blood streams, from infants to the elderly, I don't think this product can ethically be called organic!<br /><br />Most people empty cans of foods, such as tomatoes, directly into their recipes without thinking of washing them first. (How does one rinse or wash broth or soup, by the way?) In fact, many people like the salt and other seasonings in canned foods, and therefore, never consider rinsing them away. They believe it is safe to use the foods just as they are in the can, which is a reasonable assumption since that is how such products are marketed. Many, if not most, Americans do not yet realize that there is a problem and they are unwittingly feeding that problem to their families.<br /><br />There is something especially unethical and tragic about people paying a company higher prices for organic foods, thinking they are better protecting their health, only to be swallowing BPA with each mouthful, with many feeding it, an endocrine disruptor, to their children.<br /><br />BPA leeching into food is no better or safer than food grown with pesticides. Therefore, until Muir Glen stops using BPA lined cans or stops claiming the organic label and charging organic prices, I can't give high marks for either context.

Dishonest labeling of "organic" when cans contain BPA
