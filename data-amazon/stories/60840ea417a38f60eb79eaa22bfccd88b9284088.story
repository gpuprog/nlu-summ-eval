This (and maybe Diana Stobo's 2 qt bag - not sure because it's shaped differently) have got it right - no seams along the bottom to pop while you're squeezing pulp, no material that stretches, and a drawstring top, just like it should be.<br /><br />Now if only someone could come out with a nut milk bag that gets *completely clean* in the wash, even after soaking. Oh, well...<br /><br />I will say, though, that this is SMALL. Consider buying her 2 qt one instead if you're starting with more than just a cup or two of pulpy mixture.
