My dog suffers from an auto immune disorder which causes him to have to take a lot of meds. He also is on a novel protein diet and can't have many "normal" dog treats or food. After trying a million ways to get those pills in him I found these in the reduced allergen flavor. Yes, they stink horribly. But suddenly meal time is a treat and I couldn't be happier! Just wish more came in a bag and they were cheaper.

Best thing ever!
