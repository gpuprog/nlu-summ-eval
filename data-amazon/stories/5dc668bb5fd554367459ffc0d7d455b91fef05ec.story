If you like all in one meals, then Velveeta Cheesy Skillets is one you should try. I bought the already cooked sliced chicken in the meat section to add in. Pros of the meal: 1) cheesy 2) flavorful - I didn't need to add any other seasonings. It didn't require any salt, pepper, or whatever else your tastebuds may call for. 3) The servings were plentiful. It serves a family of four perfectly. There were only 2 in my house, but we had enough for lunch the next day. 4) The leftovers were just as tasty as the first night of eating it. The only con that I can think of is that the meal uses dried broccoli, which has a strong sweet taste. If you are able to substitute it with fresh broccoli or even frozen broccoli, that would balance the taste better.

Almost as good as Hamburger Helper...
