Once upon a mid-day sunny, while I savored Nuts 'N Honey,<br />With my Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 gal, 128 fl. oz., I swore<br />As I went on with my lapping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br />As of some one gently rapping, rapping at the icebox door.<br />'Bad condensor, that,' I muttered, 'vibrating the icebox door -<br />Only this, and nothing more.'<br /><br />Not to sound like a complainer, but, in an inept half-gainer,<br />I provoked my bowl to tip and spill its contents on the floor.<br />Stupefied, I came to muddle over that increasing puddle,<br />Burgeoning deluge of that which I at present do adore -<br />Snowy Tuscan wholesomeness exclusively produced offshore -<br />Purg'ed here for evermore.<br /><br />And the pool so white and silky, filled me with a sense of milky<br />Ardor of the type fantastic of a loss not known before,<br />So that now, to still the throbbing of my heart, while gently sobbing,<br />I retreated, heading straightway for the tempting icebox door -<br />Heedless of that pitter-patter tapping at the icebox door -<br />I resolved to have some more.<br /><br />Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br />'This,' said I, 'requires an extra dram of milk, my favorite pour.'<br />To the icebox I aspired, motivated to admire<br />How its avocado pigment complemented my decor.<br />Then I grasped its woodgrain handle - here I opened wide the door; -<br />Darkness there, and nothing more.<br /><br />Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br />Doubting, dreaming dreams of Tuscans I had known before<br />But the light inside was broken, and the darkness gave no token,<br />And the only words there spoken were my whispered words, 'No more!'<br />Coke and beer, some ketchup I set eyes on, and an apple core -<br />Merely this and nothing more.<br /><br />Back toward the table turning, all my soul within me burning,<br />Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br />'Surely,' said I, 'surely that is something at my window lattice;<br />Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -<br />Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; -<br />'Tis the wind and nothing more!'<br /><br />From the window came a stirring, then, with an incessant purring,<br />Inside stepped a kitten; mannerlessly did she me ignore.<br />Not the least obeisance made she; not a minute stopped or stayed she;<br />But, with mien of lord or lady, withdrew to my dining floor -<br />Pounced upon the pool of Tuscan spreading o'er my dining floor -<br />Licked, and lapped, and supped some more.<br /><br />Then this tiny cat beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br />By the grand enthusiasm of the countenance she wore,<br />Toward the mess she showed no pity, 'til I said, 'Well, hello, kitty!'<br />Sought she me with pretty eyes that seemed to open some rapport.<br />So I pleaded, 'Tell me, tell me what it is that you implore!'<br />Quoth the kitten, 'Get some more.'
