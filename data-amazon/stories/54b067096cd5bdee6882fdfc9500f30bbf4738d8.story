I don't understand the positive reviews of this particular dinner.  It used to be my favorite, lean roast beef, creamy potatoes and good gravy.  But it's not what it used to be--the meat is still ok, but the potatoes are now a  solid pasty blob.  You have to break them down with a fork, and there's not enough gravy to do it.  In my opinion these are now inedible.  Try the chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy instead--the potatoes aren't as awful and there's plenty of gravy.
