I found this at Costco (for quite a bit less than here on Amazon) and purchased it. It is absolutely delicious (subjective, I know--I'm not sure how else to present a review on a food item) and has been great on chicken and fish. It is definitely sweet (not candy sweet by any means) and not comprised of the healthiest ingredients, but if that doesn't turn someone off, it's definitely worth a try. I ordered from Amazon after Costco stopped selling them in my area and my supply started to run low.
