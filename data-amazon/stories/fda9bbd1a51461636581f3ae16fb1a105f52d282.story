Everyone is right!! Wish the company would go back to the canister, really enjoy the coffee. Package is hard to open, too small an amount, have to drink 1/2 a cup or use 2 packs. 20 packs don't last long so you have to store 8 boxes in order to have a supply. Gave it 3 stars because of the package style, the coffee is 5 star. I'm sure the company won't listen to the consumer report and go back to the canister because they're making a lot more money this way.
