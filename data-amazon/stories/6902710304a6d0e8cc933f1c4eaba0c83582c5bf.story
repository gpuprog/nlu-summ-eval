I purchased the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I4L0ZW">Cadbury Curly Wurly 1oz</a> (which from a hair point of view has icky connotations) because the author of a candy nostalgia slideshow claimed they were like my much beloved, horribly missed Marathon bars.  Now, what they lack in texture, they almost make up for in quality.  This is nice Cadbury milk-chocolate and caramel, not the brittle, purposely soured milk of M&M/Mars (if you didn't know why you keep eating M&M's, it's because the slightly soured milk in the milk chocolate leaves an aftertaste that you try to cover with . . . more candy.  Genius!  Evil, but genius.).  However, the original Marathon bar was a much thinner braid with no lumpy parts, and it could really get some stretch on it if you wanted to.  If I had a real Marathon bar and a Curly Wurly side-by-side in the present and had to choose, it might go to Curly Wurly, but memory is a powerful thing and the Marathon bar is right up there with McDonald's deep fried cherry pies, FallsBrand hotdogs with warmed mustard relish, and Sunkist Natural soda--magic foods of the past that become even more powerful as legends.  I've been off soda for 1.5 years, but will gladly go back on if there is a Sunkist Natural substitute.
