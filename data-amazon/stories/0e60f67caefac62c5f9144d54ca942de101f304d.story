If you're a gummy candy aficionado like me, you probably know that these raspberry/blackberry candies are generally considered a "lesser" version of the Jelly Belly gummies--at less than half the price of the iconic Jelly Belly candy. JB gummies have very tiny, crunchy nonpareils and distinctive, tart berry flavors.<br /><br />But wait! Having purchased a 5-pound bag of the Haribo variety, I now know it's not just a cheaper substitute for the JB candies. Their larger nonpareils actually have an interesting, less crunchy texture and provide a pleasant introduction to the gumdrop inside. The Haribo flavors, while not as distinctly berry-like as their JB counterparts, are very tasty. The gummy portion is somewhat chewier than the JB brand, and it's also less cloyingly sweet.<br /><br />In short, I really prefer the Haribo gummy berries to the Jelly Belly version...and the lower price is sweet, too!
