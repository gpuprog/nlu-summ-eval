These are delicious cookies, but I kind of wish they had left the word 'Newtons' off of the label. I like Fig Newtons, or any other fruit Newtons, but these cookies are nothing like that. I can see people either buying these, or avoiding them, because they expect them to be like Fig Newtons, and these are more like an English Tea or Lorna Doone cookie experience.<br /><br />They are lightly sweet, thin and crunchy and quite dense. They hold up well to spreads such as peanut butter without breaking. The flavor is somewhere between a homemade oatmeal cookie and some kind of upscale, deluxe granola bar. They have a richness to them; a buttery texture like finely minced pecans. The various fruits they use are finely minced, too; little tart sparkles that add to the taste. This particular cookie has chocolate and raspberry, definitely the most luxurious taste of the bunch.

Delicious cookies--nothing like Newtons, though!
