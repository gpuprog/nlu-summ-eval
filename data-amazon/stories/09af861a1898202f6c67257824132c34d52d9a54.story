I have nothing but good things to say about these bags.  No issues thus far.  They freeze well, they defrost fine, no leaks, and pour out easily.  They appear thin but are strong.  I would recommend them as they end up being cheaper in the long run with this bulk 300 bag purchase for $44.99

Great bags, no issues, freeze and defrost well and love that they are biodegratable.
