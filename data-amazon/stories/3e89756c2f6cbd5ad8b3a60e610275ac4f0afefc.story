This is some awesome tea and I fear complete addiction is coming my way.  I just tried it for the first time today and am here on amazon ordering some, so I might keep plenty on hand for my Chai drinking needs.  This is a very smooth tea and will never produce a bitter taste.  It is like liquid pumpkin pie with real whipped cream.  A major part to my mouth and serenity to my senses.  I HIGHLY recommend.
