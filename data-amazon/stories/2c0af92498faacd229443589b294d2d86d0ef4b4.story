I PURCHASED THESE FOR MY DAUGHTER AS A SNACK AND SHE LOVES THEM. I USUALLY DO NOT LIKE SWEETS OR CHOCOLATE, BUT THESE ARE GOOD. UNLESS YOU SHOP AROUND FOR BARGAINS, YOU CANT BEAT THIS PRICE ON SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE. ALSO THESE COOKIES ARE LOADED W/ CHOCOLATE CHIPS, UNLIKE THE ORIGINAL KEEBLERS COOKIES!
