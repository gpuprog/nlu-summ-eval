I've tried Peach and Mango peach and the second one is my fav. It's sugar free (sucralose is used as a sweeneter, also known as splenda).<br />I like the taste and the drink is easy to customize. Simply squirt as much as you like and liquid dissolves easily in the water.<br />Usually with powder mixers you have to stir and wait a bit for it to dissolve, no such thing with Mio.<br /><br />The bottle is small and easy on the go (gym, shopping etc).
