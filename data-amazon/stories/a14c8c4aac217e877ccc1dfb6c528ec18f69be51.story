I was rather stunned when I received the SF Bay Rainforest Blend Coffee.  They are in a very different little packet than I was accustomed to with the regular Kerig type cups.  I decided to give it a try.  I really  like it.  You can, just like with the other type, run as much water through it as you want and thus make it as strong as you want.  I really see no difference in that part.  In addition, I really like the "flavor".  Try it -- you'll like it, I believe.
