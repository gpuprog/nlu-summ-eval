First off the krinkle cut chips are far inferior to the regular style kettle chips in my opinion.  Secondly, the flavor doesn't really capture the taste of buffalo wings or bleu cheese.  They taste kinda weird.  It's probably not the best type of flavor to put on a potato chip, even though I love wings.
