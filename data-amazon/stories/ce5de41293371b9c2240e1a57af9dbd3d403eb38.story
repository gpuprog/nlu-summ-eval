My 2 yr old loves these crackers, however, he won't eat them everyday. I was a little worried to purchase these in such a large quantity but couldn't pass up the great price on amazon. I received them in November 2010 and they expire in May 2011 which will be enough time for them to be consumed.<br /><br />They taste great, love the Elmo and Big Bird shapes, and they are Earth's Best which means that they are organic!
