I consider myself a "coffee snob" (in a good way). I have a few gripes about this coffee, but overall, it is pretty good. When I opened the package, the espresso didn't have the good oily bean quality I wanted it to. The beans seemed a little old. Also, the quality of the crema wasn't as good as Starbucks espresso or Peet's. Again, the taste was good and these were both minor details.

Pretty good, but not the best
