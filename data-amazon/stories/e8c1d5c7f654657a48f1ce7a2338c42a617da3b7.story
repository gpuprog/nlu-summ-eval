Another chocolate-peanut coated candy with a whole cherry in the middle is the "Cherry Cocktail" from the Idaho Candy Company. Another bar similar to "Cherry Mash" is the "Twin Bing." With "Big Cherry," there are actually four regional candy bars with their own variations of chocolate and peanuts over a cherry filling.
