My 8 month old kitten smelled the package as soon as I put the mail down.  I put a pinch on the floor and she meowed and rolled until it was gone.  She loves it!  I couldn't find any in town so, I had to order this and it was very worthwhile.  High quality, aromatic, and nicely ground.  I will be ordering more.
