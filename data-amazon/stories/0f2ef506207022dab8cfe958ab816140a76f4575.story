Purchased this gum from Amazon since it is hard to find in the stores sometimes. Price is about the same as buying in the store, but subscribe and save is convenient. This gum is delicious; it is minty without being too strong and just a little sweet. I find many other similarly packaged gums (like Eclipse) just too strong and kind of bitter. Oh, and it also has a gooey center. Always have it in my purse!
