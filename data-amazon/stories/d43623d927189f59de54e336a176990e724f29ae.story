I first discovered Pocky Biscuit Sticks a few months ago, They're somewhat like a long pretzel (without salt) where one end has been dipped in a fudge-like candy. They're an interesting treat and, because they individually come in small portions, I like to use them as treats for my young (4 years) boy. The first ones I discovered were chocolate. This last time I decided to try the strawberry. I'd have to say that I prefer the chocolate. My boy shows no preference for one or the other.<br /><br />Gary Petesron
