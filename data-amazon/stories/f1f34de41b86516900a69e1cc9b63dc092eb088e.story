These chicken treats are good (more like the Chinese variety), but outrageously expensive ($10 for a 3.2 oz bag!) and mostly very small pieces, so after one bag, no more. Going to keep looking for something not made in China. Somewhere, someone in the US should be able to make chicken jerky for dogs without charging an arm and two legs.

Good, but small pieces and the price!!
