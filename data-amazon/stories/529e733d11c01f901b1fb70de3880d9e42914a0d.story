Normally I drink looseleaf tea, but there are times when I need the convenience of a tea bag.  This is a very serviceable flavored black tea in a bag. This has become my go-to bag when I need a quick cup of tea. The scent of this tea is utterly amazing- strong cinnamon, but not overwhelming. I could sniff the packet all day. Flavor is good for a bag. Most important to me is that the cinnamon flavor is present, but not so overwhelming that it is too sweet. All in all, a quality tea, great for when you need a bag.
