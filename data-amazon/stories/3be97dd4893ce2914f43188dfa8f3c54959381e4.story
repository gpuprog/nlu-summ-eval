While the flavor of this dough is good, I've made it four times, for different ways, and the resulting texture isn't at all what its creators say it should be.  For that reason I can't imagine it performing well as a pizza crust.  As a flatbread, it's fine.  Regardless of how much liquid I put in the dough, the edges dry easily, like a cracker, but the middle in some cases was still doughy.  So, if you just want a tasty gluten-free treat, it's great.  But it doesn't perform as its intended.
