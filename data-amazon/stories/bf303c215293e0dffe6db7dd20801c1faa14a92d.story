The respesentation of this item is extremely misleading. It is true that the description of the item includes the correct liquid weight however the image and price shown represents the larger actual size gallon product.<br /><br />Who would ever think this oil came in miniature tins replicating the larger gallon tins that is prevalent in the marketplace. The price of this product also coincides with what one would expect from the larger gallon sized product.
