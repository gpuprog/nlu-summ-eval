I have been on a beef jerky kick lately, and this is one of my new favorites. It starts with the tenderness of the meat. The meat is on the soft side but still has a nice chew to it. It's real pieces as apposed to the artificial looking variety. The flavor has a nice smoky BBQ base and the sweetness of the honey and the mild heat from the chipolte is perfect. I've tried multiple Sweet Baby Ray products and have yet to be disappointed. Grab a bag or two, you won't be disappointed.
