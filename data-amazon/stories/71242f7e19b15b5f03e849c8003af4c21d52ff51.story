Everything I've ever read says adding milk negates antioxidant benefits.  They bind to protein.  Green and Blacks adds Milk Powder to everything, including their dark bars.  Unfortunately, if you want the real benefits of chocolate, it has to be raw (never heated over 118) and organic and you're going to pay through the nose.  I recommend Chocolatl available in the raw refrigerator section of your local Whole Paycheck ($8.50 for 3oz of Chocolatl is paying through the nose to me) or finding something else truly raw and unprocessed on Amazon.  You can get the raw cacao nibs from Navitas on Amazon for much less than whole foods, but the nibs taste like a**.  Look, I love the flavor of these, they're organic, which is nice, and if you're just out for the flavor, these are great candy bars, but don't think you're getting any benefit.<br /><br />As a side note, I actually wrote to Green and Blacks to (basically complain) ask why they'd add milk powder to their dark chocolate and they literally told me it was *residue* and they had to list it.  My Bull**** meter went off immediately, because why wouldn't they just state that "made in a facility that also processes milk" or such like, but no, they claimed the ingredient was listed as a result of irremovable residue.  Yeah...ok to me that's just disgusting.  And since when can't milk residue be removed?  How many years worth is built up at Green and Blacks?  It was both disgusting and literally unbelievable at the same time that they'd think that explanation was preferable to just saying "hey, we put milk powder in our stuff; deal with it".  Anyway, if you buy this, I hope you enjoy your irremovable milk residue chocolate.  :)
