This cereal quickly became one of our family's favorite! I'm pretty picky about ingredients, I want a cereal that has no sugar, no corn products, and has minimal ingredients. This fits the bill! And the taste is GREAT! My two-year old loves them, and I even love to have them as a dry snack! Very good!
