I just bought a bottle of La Choy Stir Fry Sauce (Original) and what a waste of money!!! The good news is that I decided to try it before adding to my meat and veggies. I was in such disbelief as to how bad this actually tasted, that I figured it just wasn't possible, surely its meant to be eaten with the meat and veggies. So i put some in a small pot and heated thoroughly... disgusting! I'm not trying to be mean, but I wouldn't feed this to animals. Somebody please tell me if I did something wrong.
