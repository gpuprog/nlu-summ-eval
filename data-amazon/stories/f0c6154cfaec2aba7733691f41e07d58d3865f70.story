Pros:  Super delicious, great to have for non-coffee drinkers, tastes like apple pie w/ ice cream if you add a little french vanilla creamer-- yum, smells awesome while "brewing"<br /><br />Cons:  A dollar each?  Really?  And when I purchased mine from Amazon (because I couldn't find them anywhere in town), they were about $30 for 24 k-cups (currently, they're at $24/24).  Compared to your other non-coffee options, the per-cup cost of these gems is just silly.  I realize they're a novelty, and apparently not carried in any retail store anywhere in North Texas-- but I can't make a habit of dropping thirty bucks on novelty beverages...

Tasty... but expensive.
