My 6.5 pound dog has pancreatitis, and she wouldn't eat the prescription food that the vet recommended. She's already too thin because of her condition, so I tried Natural Balance Limited Ingredient instead.<br /><br />My little dog LOVES it!  She eats half of a large can, twice a day.  And no more digestive issues. I've also been adding it to my other dog's diet, mixing it with her kibble, and she loves it, as well.<br /><br />It would be great if Amazon would make this brand go to subscription ordering, so that I don't have to worry about remembering to buy more!! (hint-hint!!)
