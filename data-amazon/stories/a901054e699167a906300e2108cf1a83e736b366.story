My dog wouldn't eat the expensive stuff the vet sells (liver flavored).  In fact I had to grind it over his food and hope he would get enough glucosomine.  It was always a challenge.  We tried several different types.  The peanut butter dog bone is the best.  My dog LOVES it. I highly recommend it!
