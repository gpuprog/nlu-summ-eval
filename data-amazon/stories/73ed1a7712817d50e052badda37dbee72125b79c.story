If you close your eyes and try really hard, you *might* be able to pick up a feint hint of candy corn flavor in these Oreos. Otherwise, they just taste like overly sweet frosting and cheap cookies. (And let's face it, that's what Oreos basically are.) Despite all the Internet hype, these were a huge let-down. I hope the good people at Nabisco decide not to give these a repeat appearance next fall.<br /><br />It should go without saying, but don't pay the absurd prices resellers are charging for this these. Heck, don't even waste your money if you see at them at Target (the exclusive distributor of this product)... it's just not worth it.
