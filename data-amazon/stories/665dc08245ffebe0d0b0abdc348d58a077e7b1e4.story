Price per K-cups get poor marks when assessing for "value"; however, in terms of quality there is an earthiness and flavor profile that far exceeds any regular drip brew that I have experienced for home brewers (with an obvious exception for french press coffee).  What I sacrifice in terms of increased per K-Cup cost is made up for in terms of quality.  I enjoy Starbucks, regardless of their corporate profile.  Going to Starbucks is likely to result in a $4-5 dollar cup of coffee; where as I sit here now and for just about a buck I am enjoying a natural, black cup of Medium Roast Starbies... Loving it...

Great quality, expensive K-Cups...
