Before ordering these, I had only tried the regular black bean and flax, and also the Pinto bean flavors. However, since the price was less than half for the BBQ kind I decided to pull the trigger on all 9 bags! WOW! They are great! Love the BBQ flavor, the chipotle builds slowly and the flavor reminds me of BBQ chips from when I was a kid only the ingredients are healthier. So excited to actually find a chip that fits my wheat, corn, soy and potato free diet! Yay! I'm hooked and now I want to try the Cheddar as well except that I have 9 bags of BBQ ;  Better get busy!
