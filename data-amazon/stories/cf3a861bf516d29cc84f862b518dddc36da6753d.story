Great flavor. Makes waffles that are crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. And nice that the ingredients are all natural. But I have to take one star off for the fact you have to add eggs, melted butter, milk (for pancakes) and water to the mix. If I have to do all that I might as well make my own mix from scratch and save a lot of money. No, it probably won't taste quite the same, but I won't be losing any time or making much more effort. And, who knows, maybe all homemade will taste even better!
