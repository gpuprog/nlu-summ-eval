This cereal tastes good with or without milk, holds up well (keeps its crunch) with milk. The cinnamon flavor is not overpowering and it isn't too sweet. This cereal is pretty much like shredded wheat but made with oats. What the differences are nutritionally between shredded what and this cereal is, perhaps would make a difference as to which you would prefer.<br /><br />It is good, but is it really anything new? 4 starts for taste and crunch.

Not bad but is it necessary?
