I did place an order with Amazon for this particular item, but it was canceled because the supplier at the time was not able to provide it (it was not PetFoodDirect - I have had excellent service from them through Amazon).  I managed to order the 4Eva through another source, and the kitties like it.  It was something I wanted because the majority of BFF (and Soulistic, made by the same company) are tuna based (other fish added too, but mostly tuna and fish).  Once in a while it would be nice to have something else;  we get tired of the same thing every meal too!  In general the BFF foods are a good choice - better quality, not outrageous prices.

BFF is better food than some and not as expensive as others
