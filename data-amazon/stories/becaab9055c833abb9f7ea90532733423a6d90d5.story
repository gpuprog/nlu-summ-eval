If you don't care for whole-wheat / multigrain pasta, well, pass.<br /><br />If you enjoy eating pasta made from flour not completely stripped of nutrition, you will not do better than Hodgson Mill.<br /><br />All of their WW/MG pastas are excellent.  They must be cooked a little longer, to be sure, and fussed over a tad more.<br /><br />For the modicum of extra effort required, receive a plate / bowl of tasty Italian.  Add some good sauce and a few steamed veggies, and you have a fettuccine primavera worthy of any restaurant.

Fettuccine at its best
