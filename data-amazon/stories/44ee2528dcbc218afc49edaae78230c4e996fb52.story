I am very disappointed by this product. Star Kay White is claiming to sale 4 oz of Pure Peppermint Extract. In fact it is 83% alcohol by volume. when you buy this product you are buying 3.32 oz of alcohol and only .124 oz of peppermint Extract (3.12% as labelled on the bottle). The water must account for 13.8%.<br />The product is weak and diluted, not good for my uses. I don't need the alcohol nor the water. If you call this pure is must be pure 100% or change the label and publish the details on the site to reflect the true content of the product you sale.<br />Thanks for reading.<br /><br />Michel Gerard
