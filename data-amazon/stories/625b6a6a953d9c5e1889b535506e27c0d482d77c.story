all reviews which compared illy cofee to lavazza were much in favor of illy. I tried both coffee made in Bialetti Moka Express Stovetop Espresso Maker.<br />My opinion - they definetely have different taste but no difference in quality. Lavazza tastes stronger, while Illy tastes softer. Thus, I cannot justify such significant difference in price - $13 per 8oz. for Illy and $5 per 8oz. for Lavazza. I personally liked Lavazza taste better.<br /><br />Illy makes grind especially for Stovetop Moka Maker which I used. Apparently it is designed to be completely filtered out  - so there is no tiny bits of grounded coffee in the final product and no powder left in cup when it is empty. For some reason I do like these little pieces in the mouth (probably it is not good for teeth). Lavazza makes just one standard ground coffee which in finer than Illy's Moka version.
