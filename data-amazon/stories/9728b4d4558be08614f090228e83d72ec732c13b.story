Amazon's suggestion for a 4 star review is "I like it."  That being said, I gave a 5 star review to the Spicy Thai chips.  These chips are perfect for people that enjoy a spicy chip, but whose taste buds don't appreciate the added sweetness and ginger flavor.  The only thing I REALLY dislike about these chips (along with the rest of the flavors) is that the serving size is HALF the bag.  Really?  Who can eat half and save the rest for later???  Not me...
