I was totally surprised by the taste of this decaf. It is as good as it gets and beats a lot of caffeinated coffees. Well worth the try if you want decaf and haven't liked the taste before. I will buy it again. If it didn't say decaf....not sure you would know it.

no longer does decaf take a back seat
