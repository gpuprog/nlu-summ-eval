I probably should find out if Bayside Candy will set up a standing order for regular deliveries of this wonderful candy.  The 5 lb. bag has a little moisture-capturing device so the sugar crystals don't turn to goo.  I keep some in my desk at work and love to hold out the container and say, "Would you like a worm?"  Nobody turns them down, not even the people who are sour enough already.  Again, this is a product that I once found in a store, but then it vanished and Amazon was the only place where I could find it.  Amazon's selection qualifiers helped me make sure I was ordering what I wanted.  This is another strong case for my belief that if you don't know where to go for something, go to Amazon.
