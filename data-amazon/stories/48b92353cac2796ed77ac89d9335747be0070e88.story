I was looking for something less bland than Caffix.  Well, this is less bland, but the flavor and aroma are hard to describe.  Maybe like someone stirred it with a crayon?  Also a raw flour taste?  Something wasn't right......<br />Also, the powder didn't dissolve as completely as Caffix's crystals.  I had a lot of foam on top.<br />One cup was enough - I'll go back to Caffix.<br />I like Caffix better if I mix instant decaf with it. A ratio of 2/3 Caffix to 1/3 instant decaf. Much better.

It has a taste and smell that I don't care for
