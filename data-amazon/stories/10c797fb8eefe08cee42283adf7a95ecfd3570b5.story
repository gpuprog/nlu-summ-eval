I started feeding this to my dog when she was a few months old because the poor thing seemed to be allergic to everything and I couldn't figure out what was making her ill.  I've tried many holistic natural brands without any luck.  After feeding my dog this food, all of her allergy signs simply disappeared within a couple of days!  Two years later, my dog continues to enjoy this food and has not had any allergy issues.  Plus, she looks great!  I'm very pleased by this product.
