I highly recommend this for anyone doing anything sporty. It not only has the water content you need, but it's chalk full of electrolytes. Those looking solely for the coconut water might be surprised at the taste of this (very chocolate-y), but it still tastes great and has all the benefits you'd want. It also blends fantastically with chocolate or vanilla protein powders for those seeking a nice mixer for protein shakes.
