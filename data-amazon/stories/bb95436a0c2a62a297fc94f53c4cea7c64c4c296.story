I have tried many of the KIND bars, and have found the Almond Walnut Macadamia + Protein to be my absolute favorite. I was looking for a bar that has a low sugar content, and this one fits the bill better than the others. I eat one of these bars each morning! They are packed with whole nuts, and are absolutely delicious. I chose to receive these through Amazon automatic delivery because it is less expensive than what I was paying per bar in the "Organic" section of my local supermarket.
