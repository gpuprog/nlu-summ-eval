We've been impressed by every flavor of this brand that we've tried.<br />Our dog dances in anticipation of every Tiki Dog meal.<br />The cans contain the perfect amount for a single meal for our JRT and every bit of food inside is easily recognizable as real food.<br />It must taste as good as it looks, because our aging dog loves it.<br />The chicken looks like real chicken shreds, the brown rice is real brown rice, not meal and every variety is gobbled down by our beloved pet.
