These delicious cookies are free of trans fats.  They do have 130 calories in two cookies, so one should practice moderation.  We have been enjoying them for years, particularly in Vanilla, but they can be difficult to find.  Amazon offers them at a good price.  The cookies are available in Ginger-Lemon, as well, which are good sometimes for variety.
