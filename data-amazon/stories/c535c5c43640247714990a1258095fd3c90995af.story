I read several reviews on this lotion and decided to give it a try.  I have very dry skin and I really like Dove products, and this one is no exception.  Goes on very silky smooth, absorbs into my skin very quickly, but I'm not real crazy about the scent.  However, this lotion makes my skin feel really soft for a long time.  You don't need to reapply because it is a very substantial lotion, mainly because of the oil in it.  Everything I've bought by Dove is a quality product, but if I could change anything about this, it would be to make it unscented.  If they could do that, it would be much better.
