If you're taking a lot of calcium, you'll need additional magnesium. This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium. My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night). A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this. As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate). After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared. One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too.<br /><br />I've also tried a flavored version of this product (Natural Vitality - Natural Calm Rasp-Lemon, oz powder, 16 powder).  Unlike that version, this stuff is entirely odorless, and the only taste is a sense of tartness.  I much prefer this non-flavored version over the flavored version.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this product is that it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage.  That's pretty insignificant.  So, I still rate it at an Excellent five stars out of five.  Highly recommended.  Especially if you're taking calcium.
