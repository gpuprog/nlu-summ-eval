Since breakfast is the most important meal of the day, I start mine with a 'Smoothie',containing wheatgrass as a base, and then add fresh fruit,(your choice), flaxseed, fresh spinach and 1- 1/2 cups of POM juice. Blend and enjoy. I do not add ice...I drink it at room temperature...the choice is yours again..add or not to add ice. There's something about the wheatgrass that not only tastes good, but I know what it does for the body! Good stuff! Try: 1 cup of 2% milk, 1 lg. scoop vanilla ice cream and 1 lg. scoop of wheatgrass...mix in blender and drink. En-er-GEE, soooooo good!!
