Instead of delicious chocolate truffles we received a Donckels box containing a solid block of what looks white soap or wax(doesn't even smell like chocolate and I'm not going to taste it), which I see was the same experience as the other customer reviewing this product today.  I have no idea what the substance is, maybe that's what the truffles look like after they've melted in shipping or something but it is certainly not something I am going to eat.  What a disappointment, my wife and I had these truffles at Christmas time and they really were the best chocolate either of us has tasted.  I've never had a bad experience shopping through Amazon before but this one has left a bad taste in my mouth, exactly the opposite of what I was expecting.  BTW the seller was listed on the packing receipt as Potential Dynamix LLC.
