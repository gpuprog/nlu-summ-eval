I bought the smokehouse chicken breast strips because they were made in the U.S.A. They are so hard, my dog cannot chew them, and if I break them (which is hard to do), I am afraid she will choke on them. There are not very many "strips", mostly pieces.  It is a wasted $22.99, as I will not give them to her. How can you sell something so dangerous.
