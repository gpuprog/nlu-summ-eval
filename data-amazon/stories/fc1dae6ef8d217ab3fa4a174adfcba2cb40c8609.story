Like many others, I too was looking for the gas station coffee taste, as I find gas station coffee to be the sweetest and tastiest for an amateur coffee drinker like me. If you prefer the strong, exotic, even authentic taste, this is not the coffee for you. But if you are looking for coffee that is sweet, and tasty without having to do much, this is it.
