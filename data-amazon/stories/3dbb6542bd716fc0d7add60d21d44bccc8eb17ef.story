This product didn't provide any extra moisture benefits that I could see or any extra nourishment.  The nourishment I think I would have to use for a longer period of time to see the benefit if any. It contains Nutrium 10 but I haven't been able to find out exactly what that is. Dove mentions Nutrium in some of their body washes but doesn't mention exactly what nutrium means.<br /> The product has a nice light fragrance, so you don't have to worry about any heavy or "chemically" smells in your hair. I liked the sheen that I got from using it but I can't say that it is a sheen that I can't get from using my other hair products.  The moisture wasn't any longer lasting than any other product that I use.This product can be used on natural or relaxed hair and does contain shea butter. The first ingrediet is Petrolatum, second is mineral oil, followed by paraffin then lanolin wax.  I try to avoid these ingredients but I did want to try the product out. There are some good oils ( sunflower seed oil, weet almond and coconut oil, etc) listed as well. The jar comes in a 6.7 oz size so you get a lot of product.  Overall a light moisutre balm that provides good sheen.
