I have tried all of the frosted flavors and by far, strawberry is the best.It has a strong strawberry flavor with a light frosting that has the perfect sweetness. And this is coming from a non-Pop Tart fan. My order of flavor preference is strawberry, maple sugar cinnamon, cherry/pomegranate, blueberry, apple cinnamon, and surprisingly last is chocolate which I thought would be my favorite.
