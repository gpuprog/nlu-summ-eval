Now that I have developed a taste for peach gummies, and after experimentation, found the freshest, softest, most tasty example of this product apparently sold everywhere, I am disappointed with Amazon's version of the same product.  The gummies arrived safely on time.  No problem.  Everything was the same until I bit into the first one.  It looked the same, smelled the same, even tasted the same, but the texture was not soft, nor did it taste fresh.  It seemed like this product had been on the shelves for months.  I've had some that were harder, obviously old.  But these gummies were unsavory simply because they were not fresh.<br /><br />I hesitate to want any more by the subscription method.  I had chosen the seller that sent the best product, obviously Amazon did not choose MY choice.  Please cancel this subscription.  I want to receive my gummies from the vendor I know has a fresh product.  Thank  you.
