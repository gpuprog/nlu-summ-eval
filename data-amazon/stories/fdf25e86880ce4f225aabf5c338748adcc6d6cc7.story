This was so great!  I am lactose intolerant and cannot have regular eggnog, and this is great with Lactaid!!  I use it to make Chai eggnog lattes!  Very happy with this product.  Only problem, I wish it came in a bigger size!  The carton is kinda small and I used it all up in about a month having 2 or 3 eggnogs a week.  Still really like it!
