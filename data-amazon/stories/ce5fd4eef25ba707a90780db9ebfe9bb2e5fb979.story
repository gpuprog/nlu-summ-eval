I rarely drink coffee anymore since it began upsetting my stomach sometime ago.  I love iced tea and drink about 2 quarts unsweetened daily made with 2 Lipton gallon sized bags.  (yes I like it a little stronger than some folks)  Several months ago I was reading a novel where the hero was always raving about drinking Irish Breakfast Tea.  After scanning a couple of local grocers I finally found a small cellophane container of 10 bags of Twinnings green label and took it home to try.<br /><br />I think this is absolutely the best tasting hot tea anywhere.  My last shopping trip I was only able to find Twinning English Breakfast Tea...and I'm drinking it...but can't say I'm enjoying it nearly as much.  The Irish Breakfast Tea is the best.  Can't wait to get some more!<br /><br />Incidently, I do like about a teaspoon of sugar in each cup of this tea.
