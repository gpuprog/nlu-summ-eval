I've tried tons of different BBQ sauces and short of making it yourself, this is the best option.  Many of the others on the market seem to be disgustingly sweet or really runny.  This BBQ sauce is nice and thick.  I slather it on frozen chicken quarters, pop it in the oven at 325 degrees for 1.5 hours and voila!  Dinner!
