This is one of my favorite Crystal Light flavors.  I like to keep a pitcher of it in the refrigerator, especially in the hot summer.  I like that it is only 5 calories per glass and contains no caffeine and it is low in sodium.  That's three things I need to avoid!<br /><br />Crystal light is a good replacement for carbonated drinks and it is lower in cost.  One packet makes 2 quarts and the flavor puts some zest into your water.  Each canister contains 6 packets that each makes two quarts.  That's 18 gallons of flavorful pink lemonade that is Kosher and gluten free.  That is less than Â½ the price of sodas and it tastes just as good.<br /><br />My family likes it and yours will too!
