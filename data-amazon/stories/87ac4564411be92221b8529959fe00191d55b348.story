The PB2 is everything it said it was. When you mix the 2 tbls of pb2 with 1 tbsp of water just make sure you do not put in extra water as it is mushy and doesn't taste right. If you do it correctly it is the exact replica of real pb and taste just like it. i would definitly purchase it again from this seller as it arrived in good condition very quickly, it only took 2 days.
