I usually drink Silk soymilk and really like the taste, but it's hard to find plain soymilk in single-serving aseptic cartons. I like to put it in my hurricane box every summer so I'll have milk to put on cereal if we're out of power after a storm. I thought this Pacific soymilk would be just the thing, but unfortunately the stuff tastes like latex paint and it has no emulsifier in it, so it separates into liquid and clumps of solids at the bottom. Even after vigorous shaking, I couldn't get them to blend back together, and even if I could, I still couldn't get past the taste.

Worst soymilk ever!
