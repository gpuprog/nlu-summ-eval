For the past three hundred and fifty one years I have been completely, totally, utterly, unequivocally insane. And not just any insane, but the kind of turbo charged crazy that you wouldn't want anywhere near your daughter or your monkey if you've got one. It seemed nothing would help. I was doomed to live a life of madness, sitting alone in the dark eating somewhat slightly rancid deer meat while watching Batman Beyond over and over again in my mind's eye.<br />  Not to worry though!!! Stop being so concerned for me! My story has an awesome ending! Last Thursday, while I was trying desperately to do nude hand stands in my basement, I was visited by OMNIPOTENT MOON BEINGS (you know that part's important for you to read, cause I used the CAPS LOCK to make it extra special) and they suggested that I eat a Fresh Whole Rabbit. I had my doubts, obviously, but I figured that OMNIPOTENT MOON BEINGS wouldn't intentionally lie to me and so I leapt like a battle hardened war panther onto a computer terminal and ordered one. Needless to say, it was a life changing experience. The Fresh Whole Rabbit was indeed a veritable cornucopia of utopian delights. It cured me of my madness. I now command a handsome salary at a prestigious place that you've probably never heard of, and I'm dating a girl who likes to have SEX!!!! It is no joke. This product will change reality for you as you know it forever!!!!!
