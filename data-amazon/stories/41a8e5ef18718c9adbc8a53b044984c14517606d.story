As others have noted, these treats are made in China as clearly stated on the bag. I didn't like that, but the news gets worse.<br /><br />On the back of the bag is a statement: "Not for human consumption. Wash hands with soap and water after handling."<br /><br />If I have to wash my hands after handling these things, I'm sure as hell not going to feed them to my Yorkies!<br /><br />As expected, Amazon graciously accepted a return.
