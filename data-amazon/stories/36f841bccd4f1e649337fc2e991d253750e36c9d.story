I drink only flavored caffeinated coffee.  I sampled about 24 flavors of k-cups and have narrowed my favorites down to 6.  However, I do not drink "leaded" coffee after noon. Unfortunately, there seems to be only 2 flavors in decaf k-cups and I am not particularly fond of either one.  So, I went on a mission to find unflavored decaf that I like enough to drink afternoons and evenings.<br /><br />I ordered a few of those pricey 5 cup samples from Keurig.  Some of them were so bad, I threw them out.  My research paid off though.  I really like Van Houtte's medium roast decaf, which was an unexpected, but welcome surprise.<br /><br />I wouldn't like any k-cup if the grounds wound up in my cup, as a couple of people have reported here. But, that hasn't happened - at least not since I returned a defective Keurig coffee maker and received a replacement.  I might add that I am on my 8th box of this coffee, so if there was a "fragile" batch, the problem was likely corrected.
