<span class="tiny"> Length:: 9:08 Mins<br /><br /></span>While this review features the book, COCONUT OIL MIRACLE, it displays and describes other products [including coconut oil] which that book catalyzed into a healing synergy. I've reviewed most of the products shown in this video.<br /><br />Johanna Galt, thank you for your comment and question posted under the original written review I had submitted here, which I've deleted and replaced with this video [6/25/10]. Most of the content below was written in response to your question.<br /><br />I had purchased this brand a few years ago, and to be honest, I don't recall much about the flavor.  It was my first experience cooking with coconut oil, and I hadn't yet read any books on it.  The brands I've used recently and favor most for quality, aroma, and flavor are:<br /><br />EFAGold Coconut Oil, Extra Virgin, Organic, 16 oz.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Q64">Nutiva Organic  Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />Both of those brands, from my experience, are excellent quality.<br /><br />When I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583332049">The Coconut Oil Miracle (by Bruce Fife)</a> I learned a greater variety of uses of the oil and how to work with its relatively hard texture.  I had kept it in the refrigerator until I read Fife's book and learned the oil [if it's in good condition when purchased] could be safely kept in the cupboard, usually for a year or more.  There's lots of interesting, valuable information in that book, which helped me conveniently expand my usage of this miracle oil.<br /><br />I had recently read the later reviews on this NOW Foods offering and had felt that possibly I was lucky to get a better quality batch than some of those reviewers, because I don't recall the oil tasting off.  But after reading those reviews and experiencing what might be higher quality products [linked above], I will probably stay with EFAGold or Nutiva, but I'm curious enough to try the NOW Foods product on this page again for flavor and purity comparison, in case the poor reviews came from an uncommon occurrence of a bad batch of the product.<br /><br />The EFAGold jar I received seemed to be of slightly higher quality, but Nutiva is very near as good, and sometimes priced more economically.  The information on some of the Amazon product pages for Nutiva is interesting, very helpful, and impressive.  I'm now cooking so much with the oil that I bought the larger size, Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil 54 oz.  But I will also keep the 15 oz jars, as they're convenient to take with me away from home.<br /><br />To be fair, I should buy this NOW brand again to compare it to these others which I've experienced.  I've used other NOW Foods products and have been pleased with them.<br /><br />I've noticed additional brands available on Amazon which look good, too.  From the information in Fife's book, I might try any oil which is cold pressed [ANH, absolutely no heat] and extra virgin.<br /><br />I LOVE cooking with coconut oil.  It seems to me to enhance the integrity of the flavor of the food it's used with, and the savory flavor of beef steaks and other stronger meats can be furthered and the coconut edge removed by use of garlic, onions, and salty spices added to the oil when cooking.<br /><br />Some of my reviews on the above linked product pages give different information from this one, and hopefully more helpful written information from the original one which had been posted here.  In view of some of the comments and the collected "NO" votes on that review, I decided to post this video, to delete the original written review, and plan to include a copy of it at the end of the first 6 comments which had been made on the original review.<br /><br />May pleasant aromas follow your nose,<br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br />NOTE: If you have a magnesium deficiency like many people are experiencing now, feel free to read some of my reviews on magnesium products for information about ways to retain that index mineral into your system at adequate levels.  Most coconut oil has a lot of potassium in it, which can replace some of the needed magnesium.
