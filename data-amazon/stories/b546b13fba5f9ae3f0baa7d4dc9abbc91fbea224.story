I decided to try this coffee on a whim since in the town I go to college in a town that has very limited coffee selection, or else the coffee is overpriced. When I saw this, I saw two things (Hawaiian blend, and Hazelnut) so I immediately wanted to try it. So I bought it, and brewed some as soon as I could and I really, really like this coffee. This coffee seems to have the perfect balance between the coffee taste and the flavor which is awesome because many times flavored coffees taste just like a regular coffee blend.<br /><br />The only thing that I did not like was the fact that the bags are not resealable.
