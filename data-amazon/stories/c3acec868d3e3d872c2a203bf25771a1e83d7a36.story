The Pink Lemonaid flavor is good, but not great and I tire of it quickly. I will not be buying it again. I noticed that it adopts a sourness when I leave it out (mixed in water) overnight. Yuck!<br /><br />It's good every once in a while when you want a different flavor, but I wouldn't want to keep it in bulk.

Good, but not thrilled
