I made a white- fondant covered two layer birthday cake and cut a strip of the black and white damask pattern to go around the cake.  I cut a letter "J" from the same pattern and placed it on top. I adhered the pieces with thinned icing that I brushed on the fondant with a pastry brush. I finished with some cute black and white small paper flowers spaced  around the bottom. simple and pretty easy! Black and white is dramatic no matter how simple the design!
