I've wanted to try truffles for quite a while, but haven't found anything in my budget until now.  I'm already a big fan of this company, and their other salts, so knew I was off to a good start when I found this.  It is VERY good.  The truffle flavor is there (sort of an 'umami' quality), but not overbearing.  I can use the right amount of salt for my taste, and get "enough" truffle flavor to notice it.  I had also ordered a white truffle oil (not the same company), and it's "ok"....but this black truffle salt is REALLY good- already have 2 more in my cart !!
