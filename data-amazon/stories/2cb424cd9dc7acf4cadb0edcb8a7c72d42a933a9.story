I had been buying the same mini-bones from Amazon when they were sold under the Milkbone brand name. When I couldn't find that brand anymore, I started buying the AKC brand.<br />Since the smell of the AKC bones were different, my dogs wouldn't eat them. Now I dip them in milk first and they love them.<br />I'm glad the small bones were not discontinued since they are beefhide and are easy to chew.
