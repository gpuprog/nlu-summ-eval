I've had many protein bars over the years, and don't generally enjoy them because they tend to be dense and lay heavy in the stomach.<br /><br />Not these!  These bars are very light, crunchy, and delish!  Even my picky daughter likes these!  My brother had me try one, and I had to order.<br /><br />Amazon had the fastest shipping (1 day turnover, WOW!) and by FAR the best per/case prices.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed.
