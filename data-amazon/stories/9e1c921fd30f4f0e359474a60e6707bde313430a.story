These are little airy and delicious nuggets of goodness...except of course, they aren't nuggets, lol. Really though, these chips are nice and crunchy while also being light and airy. The salt and vinegar flavor is just right...not too strong, but never lacking. Actually, my only real complaint is that i find it difficult to stop eating them. However, that is simply my cross to bear.<br /><br />Enjoy!
