I agree with all the reviews about the price. It's really ridiculous that the appeal of this machine for our family was the cost of soda vs. the cost of this stuff. It' is 1/3 the price per serving of store bought soda, 1/2 the caffeine, 1/3 the sugar and calories, but it still tastes amazing. And we don't have bags and bags of recycling, and we can make whatever soda we want when we want. At this price, it's basically just buying 3 cases of soda on sale... what's the point??? When you can order it online from ANYWHERE ELSE for half the price, this is just absurd. Please just search for it, you'll find a better price in about 10 seconds.
