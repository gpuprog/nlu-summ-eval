I'm allergic to walnuts and almonds and I LOVE granola. Unfortunately for me, this means I can't really eat granola, because almonds are usually the second ingredients in granola. But then I found THIS granola! It's sweet, delicious, full of raisins and nary an almond to be found!<br /><br />It is, as the other reviewer pointed out, a little dry, but I always eat mine with yogurt or milk so until she pointed out the fact that it's dry, it didn't really occur to me.<br /><br />Bottom line?<br /><br />This stuff is AMAZING. and DELICIOUS.<br /><br />&lt;3
