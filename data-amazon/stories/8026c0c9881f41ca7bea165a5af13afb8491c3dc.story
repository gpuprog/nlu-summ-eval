I ordered the Pecan Shortbread and the Chocolate Walnut cookies in July 2006.  They were shipped in the same box.  The Chocolate Walnut cookies arrived in perfect condition, but the Pecan Shortbread cookies were all broken up into little pieces, in all of the 6 individual boxes inside the case pack.  I tried to return them online through my account login, but it says this item is not eligible for return.  So I'll be phoning Amazon on Monday to figure out how to remedy this.<br /><br />Regarding the cookies themselves, I love the Pecan Shortbread cookies, and I've been buying them locally for about 4 years.  I like them better when they're kept in the fridge, it just gives them a better crunch for my tastes.  If you need to avoid gluten, these are a winner.  I just hope the warehouse people stop giving these things the drop test...  ;-)
