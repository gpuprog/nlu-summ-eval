Wish I could say these are fantastic, but I can't.  They are extremely high in sugar, with the first three ingredients being: corn syrup, sugar, high fructose corn syrup.  They don't have any artificial colors or flavors, but the flavors, of which there are 6, are very subtle.  They don't jump out at you, so unless you eat them one by one, and really try hard to distinguish each flavor, it's hard to tell.  They are very soft, almost too soft.
