We've been drinking this and the chocolate milk from Organic Valley.  We love it.  Nice flavor, the price is right, no artificial colors, and it's nice to have this option since organic groceries are sometimes hard to find.  No added DHA like other organic milks are doing.  (DHA uses questionable chemical solvents in its processing.)
