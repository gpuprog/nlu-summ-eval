I like that Happy Baby Puffs are an organic product that "melts" better than cereals like Cheerios. My 8-month-old doesn't get many in his mouth, but he likes them when he does. I wasn't thrilled about having to order by the case, but I was having trouble finding these in local stores. But I know we'll end up using them over the years. And of course I found them at Target the day after I ordered.
