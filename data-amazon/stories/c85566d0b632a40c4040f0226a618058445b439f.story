I would like to say that I have never tried a flavor of jerky that I didn't like...  that was true until a few days ago.  I wanted to try something different and decided to stray from my usual peppered beef.  This was a mistake, I have to say this is the worst jerky/nuggets/meat product I have ever tried.  From the smell to the taste, just not good.  If you really want to give this stuff a whirl, I suggest you find a single pack.  Don't buy 4 of them like I did.  One final note:  taste is subjective, you may really love this stuff, I just didn't.
