Salty and rank with an inedible flavor and a mushy, slimy texture. I couldn't even finish the first can and I had 23 more to do. My cat took a few sniffs of it and then walked away. If he won't eat it knowing how my cat loves tuna, I won't either. It's not even pure tuna in water. It contains vegetable broth with soy on top of the salt that's in there. This little can has 350 mg. of sodium. Truly disgusting.<br /><br />There's another good review of the same tuna which is the one I saw. Had I seen these I wouldn't have bought this. I'm going to post this on the other page too.
