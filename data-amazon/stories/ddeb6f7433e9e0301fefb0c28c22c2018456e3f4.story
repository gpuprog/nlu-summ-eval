Shipment was fast!  I ordered on Sunday of a holiday weekend and got them on Thursday.  The bag is huge!  There were 132 beans in my bag and even though they are described as 6-7", mine are more like 8".  Just to do the math; 132 beans @ 31.95  comes out to less than 25cents per bean!  It's crazy that vanilla beans cost like $5 each at the grocery store.  Now I just need lots of ideas to use vanilla beans, as I have many, many more than I anticipated.
