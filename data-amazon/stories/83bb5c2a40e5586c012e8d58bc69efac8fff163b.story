Having been out of the US for a while, there are some things I have definately missed.  I've even hunted for online recipes for this cornbread, some are close, but they're just not the same.  Usually for Christmas I'll even ask family in the states to send me some in the mail because shipping for this item is usually so expensive.  Now I've managed to order some in, and I'm so happy!  I've made several batches already, some my husband ate completely.  It tastes so good and it's so easy to make!  Thank you for making this item available on Amazon!
