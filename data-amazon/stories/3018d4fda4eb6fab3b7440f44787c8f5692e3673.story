I make Uncle Lee's White Tea all year round in Florida.  I seep 8 bags per gallon jug and drink probably 4 gallons per week.  It is great to have plenty of inexpensive and tasty tea always handy with the auto delivery.  I used to get this tea at my Sam's Club but they no longer carry it.  I was glad to have found it on Amazon!
