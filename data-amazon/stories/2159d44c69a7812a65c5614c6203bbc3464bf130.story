I have had mate in South America, the gourds packed full of leaves, but this was my first trial in the US.  I had hoped that the milder tea bag version might warrant reconsideration, but mate is really just horrible stuff.  Both my husband and I describe the taste as dirty and pungent.  Guayaki's flavored mate's warrant some consideration if you want the health benefits, but I would stay away from the original unless you really are a mate fan.

Mate, more than an acquired taste
