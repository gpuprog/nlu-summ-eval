I grew up eating "pancake syrup", not true maple syrup. Quite a few years ago a friend had mentioned to me how maple syrup is so much better. I bought the smallest bottle I could find at the store and I thought it tasted horrible and went back to my pancake syrup. This time I actually purchased this to use with the Master Cleanse. I haven't started it yet but decided to give this a try with some pancakes. Wow, I was pleasantly surprised. This actually tastes pretty good. It has a thin consistency though. Maybe because I'm so used to my pancake syrup that is thicker. Either way, I really liked this and I will order more in the future.
