Shipping was horrible. They claimed they couldn't keep it cool for delivery to  NY in the summer (How come Godiva can?)<br /><br />Chocolates good, but........  (others can be better-maybe these were just handled & shipped so poorly that they were no longer good).<br /><br />Gave as gift, I think I can probably do better.
