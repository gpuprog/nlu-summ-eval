The Snackwell's Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn is sweet, crunchy and tasty.  It is a satisfying snack.  In fact, I think they could've left off the drizzle for fewer calories or put fewer pieces in the bag to get the calorie count below 130.  If they did this, it still would make for a good treat.  At first I saw 130 calories and this small bag and thought it just wouldn't be worth it, but the popcorn is so flavorful and the texture so good that I'm planning on keeping a box on hand as a kitchen staple.<br /><br />This product is a real winner especially for those of us trying to maintain a healthier diet.
