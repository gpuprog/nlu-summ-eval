I got this to go with the HCG diet - Not much flavor.  I tried chocolate and English Toffee - both had more flavor.  Difficult to find in stores -and much more expensive in stores.  Worth it to have a different flavor - but if only buying a couple buy a different flavor.  Ones that come in packages of 2 are a better deal.  Find a friend and split!
