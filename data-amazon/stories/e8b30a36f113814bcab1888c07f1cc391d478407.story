This bone is MASSIVE!!!  Probably the biggest bone that I have ever seen.  My 135 lb. bullmastiff puppy loved this!  When I opened the packaging, 1/4 of the bone was broken and fell off, which was fine because I didn't want to overwhelm my puppy.  I was able to store the larger part in the fridge for another time.  He gnawed on it all day and night, but later in the evening, threw up a big pile on the carpet.  I think all of the fatty bits made him get an upset stomach, so I put the bone away until the following day.  He is a serious chewer and pretty much got that small portion down to a piece that could fit in the palm of your hand, with bits of bone laying everywhere.  Obviously, he ate most of the pieces and 2 days later was throwing up.  Needless to say, even though this bone is awesome and your dog will most likely love it, you probably need to limit their access to very short periods of time and definitely supervise.  It also smells horrible and the smell will get all over your dog and anything it touches.  I will not be bringing the other larger piece out for a long while.
