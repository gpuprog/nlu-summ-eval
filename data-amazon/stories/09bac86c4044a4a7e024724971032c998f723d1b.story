These mini shells are wonderful.  I made cannolli's for a work party and everyone raved about them and asked how to make the shells.  They were shocked when I told them I bought the shells.  The shells arrived in one piece, fresh and tasty.  The shells that were left over I placed in the freezer for future use.  I only have 4 boxes left out of the 12 that arrived.  I will purchase these shells again.  Why make your own when you can buy such a great product?
