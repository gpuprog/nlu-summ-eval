I bought this food after searching through many websites to find the right nutrition for our 3 dogs.  We decided to give it a try and our Collie/Lab was hesitant b/c of all the junk her previous owners had fed her.  The Yorkies and even the cat immediately jumped in to chow down.  Our Collie/Lab has now decided this food is great and we even purchased the dry food to go along with it.  I was very happy to see this food rated 4.5 out of 5 stars in a food guide at our local boutique pet store.<br /><br />This will be our primary dog food for a long time.
