You can really tell that this is 100% shade grown coffee, because there's absolutely no bitterness to it at all... It's so creamy and chocolately. My coffee lounge, Espresso Brazil, uses these beans - the shots are creamy and mellow, and very flavorful. I have some regulars from Italy and Brazil that tell me it's some of the best coffee they've had in the US!
