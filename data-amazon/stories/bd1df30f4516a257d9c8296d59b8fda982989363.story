This is a superbly nutritious grain that is also easy to fix.  Because it has already been rinsed, one can use it without rinsing off the hulls.  I ate it first with some mushrooms with parmesan cheese sprinkled on it.  It was delicious.  I introduced it to someone from India and she found that she could use it with her Indian recipes.  Another woman ate it with her homemade chili.  It is a complete protein, so it serves as an excellent breakfast grain.
