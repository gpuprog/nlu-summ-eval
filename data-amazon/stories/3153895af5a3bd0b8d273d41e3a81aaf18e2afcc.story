I have tried the "linguini style" but prefer the "rice" shaped Miracle Noodle. Since they have zero calories it cuts the total in any dish we substitute them in for rice. They don't need as much moisture as rice does, so we had to get used to changing that in the recipes, but we don't really lose any taste, even if the dish ends up a little soupy. My favorite is Spicy South West Chicken. We usually have that a couple times a month at least, so I got on the auto ship for Miracle Noodles from Amazon.com. Just remember to blanch the noodles with boiling water to rinse off the fluid they are packaged in, then let them "dry" out a little while on some paper towels. That way they can absorb more flavor when you add them to the recipe.
