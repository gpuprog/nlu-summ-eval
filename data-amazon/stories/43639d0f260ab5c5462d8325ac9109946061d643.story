Many of us have experienced vodka from our youth, where it was popular for mixed drinks.  Having good taste was about paying a little more to minimize the impact in the morning.  We wouldn't notice the taste differences when used for mixed drinks, or drunk as frozen shots, often drunk quickly.<br /><br />We went to a vodka tasting recently that featured 5 vodkas of varying prices and made from different ingredients.  We sampled them straight up / neat, one at a time.  The best of the lot was the Karlsson Gold.  Yes, it was a tasting sponsored by Karlsson, but it had a good selection of other vodkas, including one we had been buying, but I was impressed enough that we bought a bottle to enjoy at home from the local store (thirty-two dollars).<br /><br />The flavor from the Swedish potatoes is quite good.  There is more flavor than just the vaguely sweet flavor I find in vodka.  It is difficult to describe, but I imagine that someone who appreciates dry brandies might enjoy it.<br /><br />Because this is about flavor, you would not use Karlsson Gold in mixed drinks.  You probably would not taste the difference, and it costs more than less flavorful but otherwise good brands.<br /><br />These are first impressions.  I'll update the review in a few months, or when the bottle goes dry, whichever comes first, and give my thinking then.
