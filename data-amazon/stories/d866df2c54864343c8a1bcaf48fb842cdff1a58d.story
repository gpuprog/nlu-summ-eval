If you can eat an entire one of these little packages in a half a day, you won't have to worry about staleness. However, I would just recommend getting the regular size with less individual packaging and using a reusable zip bag or other container to keep the rest from getting stale. The graham crackers themselves were the usual good but not outstanding Honey Maid fare.

Still got stale easily, but a nice thought
