Maybe my family is too used to mass market pancake mix but this was just too "au natural" for us.  i knew the 10 grain mix would be more substantial and flavorful good or bad than Bisquick but these pancakes come out heavy and very dark and the combination of the flavor, appearance and texture was just too much for my city kids to take too.  we've found that Kodiak Cakes Frontier waffle mix is a lot more palatable and when paired with a better maple syrup the kids can't get enough.<br /><br />in the end if you really like heavy dark buckwheat cakes this might be for you, but if you want to get away from the standard bisquick/aunt jemima mix to something with excellent flavor and texture, go for the Kodiak Cakes.

Just not for us
