I have never been one to rely on nor crave a nutritional bar. Following a gluten-free and low-allergy controlled diet, I stumbled across these KIND bars while looking for nutritious options for my teens, thinking I would be able to try them. Well indeed they truly are scrumptuous. My 18 year old loves them and when running out the door will grab one or two for the road. I have only tried the Walnut and Date and the Cranbery, Almonds and Oxidants varieties as I follow a blood type diet and also do not love foods that are too sweet. We are on our second box of each and I will be looking at the other varieties to try in time.

Scrumptious bar, nutritionally giving, allergy-kind.
