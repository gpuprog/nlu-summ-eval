These work well grilled as sausages in scant oil, roasted over coals or campfire, cut up and put into many recipes. They can be made into good corn dogs too. I think they are the best canned veggie dog with Worthington Super Links in second place. The liquid the sausages are packed in makes good stock for soup or gravy.
