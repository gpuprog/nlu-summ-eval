If you are like me peanut butter is your crack! However, at 200 calories a serving it is a large dietary investment. But with PB2 all worries are put to rest. With only 45 calories per equivalent serving you can't get better than that. I love this product. It tastes and has the same consistency as normal peanut butter when mixed with water. Take my review along with all the other reviews and TRY IT.
