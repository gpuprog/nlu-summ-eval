now these obviously aren't as flavorful as fresh young coconuts but vitacoco's flavor is the best among the coconut waters on the market (zico & o.n.e. just don't compare) and it contains more electrolytes.  you really feel the difference when you hydrate with this rather than water or other sports drinks & it's great to stock up on in preparation for those mornings when you wake up under the weather.  my only gripe would be that the container is less travel-friendly because the lid isn't particularly secure, but as long as you're not throwing your bag around, you shouldn't have an issue.
