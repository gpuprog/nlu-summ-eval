This matcha is good compared to its price. It is fine and strong smelling. I like to use this matcha to make smoothies and works great.However, the tea comes in a resealable bag that does not reseal very well, so it is best to transfer the tea into another container to prevent air from seeping into it, and one bag last along time.This matcha is bitter, strong, and delicious.
