These are terrible, I struggled through eating the first bag, then just tossed the other bags.  I opened the first bag and handed these out to my coworkers to ensure it was not just me, but there is unanimous agreement, terrible and NOT crunchie, as the namesake suggests.  The texture is like rubbery styrofoam.  The only thing I can say is these are yucky rubbery artificial-like taste. Maybe it is freeze-dried strawberries that just taste like this, but I will not be ordering freeze-dried strawberry anything after getting a taste of these.
