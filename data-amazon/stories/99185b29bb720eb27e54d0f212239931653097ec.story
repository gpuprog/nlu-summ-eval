I enjoy fresh ground pepper, who wouldn't.  This innoative product allows that.  There are however, two very minor drawbacks, but not serious enough to keep me from buying this producct again.  There is no way to adjust the grind for fine, or coarse.  Lastly, it is very difficult to turn the grinder because it's small, and I can't get a good grip on it.
