I first used the regular version of Green Superfood, which, in my opinion, is the best-tasting of all the greens powders (believe me, I've tried 'em ALL). NOW, with the Chocolate Green Superfood, I can have a Chocolate Smoothie everyday with a banana and hemp protein powder and I am flying through my schoolwork, making good grades, and my teachers are amazed at my sustained energy and attention.<br />I can't stop smiling all the time because I just feel so GOOD. Everyone asks me my secret! SHHHHHhhhhhh... I won't tell if you won't ;-)
