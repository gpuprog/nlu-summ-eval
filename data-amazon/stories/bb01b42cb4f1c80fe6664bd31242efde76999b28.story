When I first tried these pretzels, I actually liked them better than regular pretzels! They're crunchy, salty and satisfy a snack craving. The size bag my grocery store carried was small and inconsistently carried so I was excited to fine this on Amazon. The serving is surprisingly a lot of pretzels and the packs couldn't be more convenient for on-the-go snacking. One of my fave gfree finds of the year for sure
