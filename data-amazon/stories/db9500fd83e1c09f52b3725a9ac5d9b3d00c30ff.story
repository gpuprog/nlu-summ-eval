We picked up 3 bottles of this about a month ago at a Winco grocery store in Northern California for $2.00 per bottle.  It is a delicious edition of Heinz Ketchup.  It is rich and tangy, with a not too sweet flavor.  I would recommend this on any hamburger, we had it with sweet potato fries and it was so good.  We even used less of this than we usually do with regular ketchup.  We have actively been looking for this ketchup at all stores we go to and we haven't been able to find it again.  I did read in a magazine that Wal-Mart will be carrying it for a limited time for the same price point that we bought it at.  I also heard a Heinz executive mention it as an upcoming new product, so hopefully it will become more available before it goes away forever.

Extremely tasty but very hard to find.
