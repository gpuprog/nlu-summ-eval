I ordered this bouquet for my Mother-in-Law as a late Mother's day present. It arrived on the day I selected, which also happened to be the day she had been in a car accident. When she arrived home, there was an enormous box containing the flowers. She was overjoyed with the bouquet and when I saw it a few days later, it was still gorgeous and enormous. I would definitely order this product again.
