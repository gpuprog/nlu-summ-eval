I have tasted a few flavors and so far this is the best! I absolutely love it! So much so that I buy it buy the case now. I don't think it makes you jittery; just an all around great drink. I have tried the cola and that is also fantastic but my fav is the wild berry. I tried the green tea and it is hardly drinkable.<br /><br />Two thumbs up for this drink!
