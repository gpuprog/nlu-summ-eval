This was a split in the family - my husband and son did not notice a metal taste - but my daughter and I could taste it overwhelmingly! I drink Poland Spring Seltzer lemon flavor etc... from cans so that isn't the issue.  I've had this same soda in bottles and love the taste - especially the grapefruit!  This has much less sugar than regular soda and is organic.  But, did you know it is made by PEPSI??  I didn't until I wrote to the company online to tell them about the metal taste and received an email back from PEPSI. It is a tad deceiving for the IZZE company to claim to be its own entity when it is owned and operated by PEPSI.  Maybe it is like many of these organic companies who were bought out by the big giants - unable to make it on their own...<br />But, the metal taste was so bad we were unable to drink ANY of them!
