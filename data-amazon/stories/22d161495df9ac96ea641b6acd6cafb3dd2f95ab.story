Have a celiac GF so often stuck eating Gluten Free items when I COULD have the real thing. Often it is heart breaking how bad the items are. This is pretty good. It's not fantastic, but hey, its Gluten Free and for Gluten free these are good enough to eat without covering in cheese, etc. If you need Gluten Free you will not hate these!
