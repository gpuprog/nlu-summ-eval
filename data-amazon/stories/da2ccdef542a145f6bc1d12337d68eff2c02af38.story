Our daughter needs a gluten-free diet. We've "taste tested" lots of things. Lucky for us she isn't a picky eater, but she DOES know what she likes. And she LOVES these cookies. Great for lunches, great for snack! And we have the peace of mind that it's healthier than other (sugar laden) alternatives.
