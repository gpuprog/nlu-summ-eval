I picked this truffle salt because of the user reviews.  When I opened the jaw, the aroma was like a brick in the face.  I thought that the flavor was going to be watered down, but couldn't be wrong.<br />I read that it was great on eggs, so I took a pinch and added it to my eggs.  When I took a taste I nearly vomited. I may have added too much, or may be like the husband of another reviewer.  This may be just a flavor that is a love it or hate it.  I REALLY wanted to love this stuff, but it's just vile to my taste buds.<br />I gave it 3 stars because I want others to know that they may be cursed with my genetic taste buds.  I envy those of you that love it!!!!!
