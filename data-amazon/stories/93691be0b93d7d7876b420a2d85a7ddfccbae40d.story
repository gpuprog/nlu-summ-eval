If you really want to enjoy a cup of English tea :-<br /><br />  1.  If making in a cup, put the tea bag in first  and then pour in FRESHLY BOILING water.<br />  Add sweetener and/or milk to taste.<br /><br />  2.  If making in a tea pot, FIRST WARM THE TEAPOT and then put in one tea bag per cup.<br />  Pour in FRESHLY BOILING WATER.<br /><br />  3.  Never add water if more cups are required - make a FRESH pot.
