I wasn't sure what to expect when I first tried the Izze Sparkling drink, but I was pleasantly surprised. The drink is carbonated, but the carbonation is just right, not too strong or too weak. Although the 8.4 oz drink has 90 calories and 21g of sugar, it does contain 70% fruit juice which can be pretty sweet.<br /><br />This is a refreshing drink, and a nice size if you want something less than a regular 12 oz can. There is very little after taste, if any at all, and the beverage provides a refreshing light feeling clem juice inspired experience. Also, Izze drinks are best served cold!
