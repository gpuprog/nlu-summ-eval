I love natural Peanut Butter however avoided it occasionally due to the thought of making a mess and the time involved in stirring it up. Took a chance with this mixer and I am very happy with the purchase. Have only used it a couple of times so not sure how well it will hold up over time (reason for only 4 stars). Mixer pulls through the lid clean which is a nice plus. Would recommend this to a friend.
