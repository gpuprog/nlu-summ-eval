First of all, I really enjoyed the flavor of the chocolate Nutrition shake in the Gatorade Performance Series.  Delicious, really, maybe not quite ice cream frappe-calibre, but I was very impressed, enjoyed it fully, and it would certainly satisfy any desert craving.<br /><br />That out of the way, I am simply not the athlete qualified to ever drink one of these shakes.  I felt almost as guilty drinking this shake as I would if I was eating a pint of Ben & Jerry's.  Well, at least a half-pint;  Eight grams of fat (1.5g saturated) is maybe not the worst, but after running four or five miles to lose the fat, I don't want to take them back in with a beverage.  I'd rather have them in a big steak.<br /><br />The carbs are what get me; 54 grams.  That is a LOT of energy, 34 of them from sugar(s).  This is a 10K-supply of carbohydrate replenishment in my book!  If you're trying to bulk up, this is probably a great drink for you.  The 270mg of sodium is high, and I was surprised to see that there's 5% of your daily intake of cholesterol in there as well.  The 20g of protien was nice.<br /><br />In short, it seems to me that this drink is good for those with rapid metabolisms who are looking to gain wieght.  There certainly is a lot of nutrition in each can, probably ideal for wightlifters, but for those who are trying to slim down, I would not advise popping any of these open unless you're looking for dessert.
