This English Breakfast tea from Higgins & Burke, is good: it's basic, good tasting black tea (English Breakfast blend) and is tasty.  I wasn't blown away by the flavor, but it was good: I enjoyed the tea, it brewed up quickly in these nice tea bags (I recommend about one minute of brew time), and then added a splash of cream: it was quite nice!
