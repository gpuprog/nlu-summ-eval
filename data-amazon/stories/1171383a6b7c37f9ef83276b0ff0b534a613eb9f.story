This is the first coffee I tried when I got my Keurig.  I was so disappointed in the flavor; tasted like plastic (like drinking bottled water that was left in a hot car).  I thought maybe I hadn't cleaned the Keurig enough so I put through more water and brewed another cup...same horrible taste.  I would not recommend this brand to anyone.
