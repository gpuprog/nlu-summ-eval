I bought this for a good friend who is deployed to Afghanistan and getting a couple of pounds of his favorite flavor of gummy bears absolutely made his day. Even though it took over a month for the package to reach it's destination (not the shipper's fault, just due to the location), the gummy bears were still fresh and delicious.
