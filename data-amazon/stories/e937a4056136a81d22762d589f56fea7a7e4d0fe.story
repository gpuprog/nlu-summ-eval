After trying several other products for freezing baby food, I came accross this item and although I was not thrilled about the price, ordered it and was pleased with the ease of use. The tray is easy to fill, has a working lid, easy to empty once frozen and easy to wash. If you're making big batches of baby food (like I was) then you will need to buy more than one tray, but it's worth it to have a product that delivers.
