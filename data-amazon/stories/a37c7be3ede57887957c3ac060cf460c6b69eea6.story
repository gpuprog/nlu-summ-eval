I have tried three different Yogi tea varieties and they are great. Compared to similary products that I have bought in the grocery store in the past, Yogi teas have more flavor and seem to produce a stronger infusion. They are about the same price as the comparable teas. The Bedtime tea is so flavorful that sweetening is not needed. The desired effect of the tea is to produce sleep and it works. I recommend this tea.
