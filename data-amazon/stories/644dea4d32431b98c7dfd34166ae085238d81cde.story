My love affair with miso, the flavorful paste made from fermented soybeans, started when I lived in Tokyo several years ago.  So, since then, being the miso snob that I am, it has been unimaginable to me to try any instant variety.  But I have to say that when I finally did break down and try Kikkoman Instant Tofu Miso Soup, I was amazed to find that it was practically indistinguishable in flavor and consistency from miso soup made from the actual paste.  While I would still choose the actual product whenever time permits, I would now not hesitate to substitute this great product when I am on the run.
