Good, but you can make your own for a whole lot less. The mix is "just add water", but you can dispense with the artificial creamer by using milk instead: mix a tablespoon ea. of "Dutch processed" cocoa and sugar, 1/8'tsp ea. of salt & cinnamon, and a dash of cayenne pepper in a mug, add 1-2Tbs water and make a paste. Microwave for 1 min @ 70%, fill cup with milk, mix well and microwave for 2Â½ min on high. After the first heating, the paste should be thick; watch the second heating toward the end, cooking time may vary and you don't want it to boil over. Adjust spices to taste.
