I love myself a sweet caramel macchiato from Starbuck's, but they're overpriced and high in calories/sugar.  While I still enjoy one as an occassional treat, these taste wonderful for a morning cup of coffee.  I still have to have sweetener, so I also add some flavored creamer in mine.  I've tried a lot of different flavored k-cups and these are my favorite.  Just wish Green Mountain made them in decaf.  I live in Colorado, so sometimes a hot cup of coffee would be nice at night, but I wouldn't be able to handle caffeine.
