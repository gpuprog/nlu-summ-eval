This coconut oil is the best I've used by far! I use it for everything, cooking, baking.  I love using it on my skin and hair and this stuff smells amazing! it smells like coconut candy.  Better using this stuff than lotion It makes your skin sooo smooth! Look up coconut oil uses and this stuff is worth it's weight in gold!
