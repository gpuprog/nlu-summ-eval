I remember these from when I was a kid.  I think the ones I had were London House though.<br />These were pretty good, and once the bag was opened I ate them all in short order.<br />The only problem was that mny of them were broken or separated and not whole.<br />If that bothers you then you wouldn't like these.<br />I'll try the other brands too to see which are the best.
