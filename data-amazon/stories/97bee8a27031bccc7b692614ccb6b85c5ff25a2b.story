I love these banana cookies even though I can eat any other brand/ingredient.  Yes, the texture is DIFFERENT, but that's what I really like about them.  It kind of reminds me of mexican wedding cookies -dry, melt in your mouth texture.  They are really expensive compared to name/store brand cookies, so I have to maintain my self-control and eat only one every few days :(
