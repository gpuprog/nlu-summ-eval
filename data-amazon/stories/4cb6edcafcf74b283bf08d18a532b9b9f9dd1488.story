Moles and/or Voles were turning my garden into swiss cheese.  After putzing around for 2 years, I put this stuff down twice about 7 days between apps, right before some forecasted rain showers...this really works.  I have to admit, I put it down about 2x per the instructions, and then followed up with a liquid concentrate from another company, covering the gardens and lawn.  I would definitely use this again!
