Yes, because it does taste like lucuma in its original form. No, because it is quite expensive for what one gets. Let's say you decide to make an ice cream and use conventional methods, it will take most of the package. Lucuma has always been a truly unique kind of fruit, plus its added benefits in terms of health, you can make use of it in several ways. Smoothies, ice cream, pies, icings etc. From what I have read it maintains well in dry form but perhaps looses some of its intensity in flavor, but from what I tried not very much. 3.5 Stars.
