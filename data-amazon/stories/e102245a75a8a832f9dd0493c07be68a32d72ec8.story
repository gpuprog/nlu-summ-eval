I agree with the previous reviewer who mentioned that you must add more syrup than recommended to achieve a good root beer taste. At first, I thought this syrup was disgusting. There seemed to be a watered down "tea" taste to the product as another reviewer had stated. I decided to add more syrup as recommended and surprisingly the taste improved. Not the best root beer I have ever had, but certainly as good as some of the popular brands at the grocery store. And much much much better than the normal sodastream root beer flavor that had that awful splenda aftertaste.

Decent Root Beer (Add More Syrup!)
