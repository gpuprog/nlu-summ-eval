This is now our favorite tea. It's great as iced tea. Now we are spoiled and are not satisfied with a pitcher of tea from tea bags when we can have a tall freshly brewed glass of English Breakfast. Also enjoyed it in winter as hot tea. We drink a lot of it so we use decaf. We will be keeping this on hand always.
