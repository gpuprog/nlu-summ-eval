This stuff is incredible.  I picked up a few bottles for my husband who's a big Marley fan and also happens to enjoy tea...  Before he got to them, I had about half a bottle one afternoon while we were playing with our kids.  I sat down on the couch and ended up taking a nap (which is something I never ever do).  Guess I should have read the label first!  I thought it would just relax me, not put me to sleep - so now I drink a half bottle before bed.  Sounds cheesy, but it quiets my anxious mind.  I sleep SO well with this tea and I wake up feeling happy and refreshed (not weighed down and grumpy as I usually am in the morning).  Keep in mind, I'm a lightweight at 117lbs and 5'4.<br /><br />NOTE:  I found this at the store at 1.50/bottle... I'm really bummed that Amazon jacked up the price here.

do NOT drink unless you can pass out!
