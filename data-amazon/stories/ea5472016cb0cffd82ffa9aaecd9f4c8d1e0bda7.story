OK, so you know how you buy those wonderful-looking ravioli in the deli-case, sure they'll make a wonderful meal this week, except, well, life happens, and by 2 weeks from now you haven't even gotten around to them and have to throw them out?<br /><br />Thanks to the previous reviewer, whose assurances we took on faith, we gambled and bought a whole case of these, sight unseen (later we found them at our local supermarket, same size, same brand, but higher price).<br /><br />Turns out, they're delicious!  My very picky husband raved about them last night.  And we both love the fact that we have a luscious, simple meal on hand -- IN THE PANTRY!  No more crowding of the refrigerator, no more throwing out expired delicacies.<br /><br />If you ever stop to eat on the way home from work because you're too tired to cook anything complicated and you're not sure what's still fresh in the fridge, hurry:  order yourself up a case of these, and I'll bet you'll have that problem solved twice a week!<br /><br />Tip:  for a gourmet, restaurant-quality sauce that's even faster and that, like this, stays in the pantry until you need it, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012HP1CC">Bertolli Premium Pasta Sauce, Summer Crushed Tomato & Basil, 13.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a> -- microwaves in its own pouch in 90 seconds.  NINETY SECONDS!  NO POT!  Tastes "10 times better than the fresh tomato sauce in the deli case", says my husband.  Makes the ravioletti into a gourmet dish too.<br /><br />Bet you didn't know you could put a gourmet dinner on the table in less than 20 minutes with only 1 pot -- the one to boil the pasta!  :)  And at only about $4 for two of you (no, both the pasta and sauce say they feed 3 people, and they both exaggerate -- count on 2), it's still a steal.  Compared to what you would have spent at the cheapest fast-food or take-out place?  And with only 1 pot (use one with a strainer built in, like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5BIDE">Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless 3-Quart Cook and Pour Saucepan with Cover</a>, so you don't even have to use a separate strainer!) plus 2 bowls plus 2 large spoons to wash, well, I don't think it gets much better than this!  :)
