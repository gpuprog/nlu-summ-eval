I love curry and have made it at home for years.  I typically have bought the curry in the bottle at the grocery store and this is far superior.  Living in Vermont we have few stores that sell such varieties and I am grateful to have Amazon offering such product.  The curry is fresh and delicious; my only minor complaint is the packaging.  It comes sealed in a plastic bag in a cardboard container.  Not the end of the world, but a glass bottle would have been preferred.
