EIGHT of twelve of the German Potato salad cans were dented and damaged. I am stunned and want a complete refund. I have been using Amazon for over ten years and this is the very first time I have been disgusted with an order. It is horrifying you would send out or ship an order in this condition. A very, very unhappy customer. Elodie' King

They send you dented and damaged cans. Do NOT buy from this place
