I placed an order for three Community Coffee Private Reserve Ground Coffee, Medium-Dark Roast, 100% Chicory, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6), thinking it was coffee. When I first looked at the product description it said 100% coffee. But it's 100% chicory and I called Amazon to clarify their description. I like the taste of chicory blended into my coffee. I use half a table spoon for every three spoons of coffee. It has a unique but pleasant flavor, but you can't drink it straight. I am not blaming Amazon and giving it five stars because it is what it is, chicory that is a good buy and helps flavor my coffee. If your a chicory fan then this review is useless. But if you are like myself, remember this is not coffee.<br />I hope you find my review helpful.
