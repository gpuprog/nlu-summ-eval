I'd seen some reviews saying the treats were old but I'd had good luck -- that ran out with this last shipment.  They were obviously old, meat darkened and extremely hard, and my dog became sick.  I can't seem to find these treats any longer that aren't either made in China or of inconsistent quality or both.  My dog will have to adjust to not getting her favorite treat -- I feel they're getting too risky.

Very poor quality, made in China
