Just so you all know these are $7.50 at Wal-Mart so I recommend you don't buy these. But yet on the other hand this could also look like a good deal because if you buy these out of a vending machine they could cost as much as $1.00 a pouch which would equal $36.00 for all of these. So you are basically getting these half off if you use vending machines a lot. But if you get these at Wal-Mart it's like getting 2 big cases which is (72) pouches for the current price of "one" box on here which is ($16.94). Just be smart while shopping on here and compare prices in the store before you buy online. Happy shopping.
