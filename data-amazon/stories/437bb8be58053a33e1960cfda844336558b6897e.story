My son is allergic to peanut butter so I was looking for an alternative that our whole family would enjoy.  I have tried almond butter in the past and liked it.  However, the SunButter is much creamier than the almond butter that I've used in the past.  The SunButter tastes great.  It tastes a lot like peanut butter.  The creamy texture also makes this product easy to spread even out of the refrigerator.  It's a great product!
