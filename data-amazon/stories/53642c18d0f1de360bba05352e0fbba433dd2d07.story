I was not worried about buying these gummy bears because I do not have a reaction to lycasin.  I eat sugar free candy all the time and lycasin has always been fine in reasonable doses. I only ate 5 little gummies and I got very sick.  I did not feel okay.  My head was fuzzy and I was so dizzy I could not see straight or stand and had to lie down for some time.  Also, my speech was slurred.  I had some flatulence and it was very toxic smelling like CHEMICALS.  Is it the artificial flavors or colors....  I don't know and I don't care.  No more for me.
