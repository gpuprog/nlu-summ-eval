I can't believe I actually bought this stuff in the stores. They charge half as much for less than a quarter of the product.<br /><br />Because it was soo expensive, I started buying proprietary blends of "seasoning salts" from spice sites around the net. Most of them were good and were comparable in price, but none of them were exactly what they were trying to emulate: Lawry's.<br /><br />Finally, I decided to check back to Amazon to see what the real stuff cost. I was shocked to find out that I was paying the same or more for imitation products. I immediately bought it and have never looked back.<br /><br />If you've never had Lawry's, you're in for a real treat. Many recipes call for "seasoning salt." Well, they are generally referring to "Lawry's' without mentioning the name. You can pretty much sprinkle this stuff on anything. It is great on fries; I mix it with flour and bread crumbs to coat chicken, It could probably be substituted for poultry seasoning.
