I am a bit of a hot food aficionado.  I long moved off regular Tabasco and now need the habanero Tabasco to get a decent burn.  So after reading about the jolokia pepper I eagerly ordered this sauce, paying through the nose given the extra shipping cost. However I was very disappointed. I find the habanero Tabasco to be hotter than this stuff.  I'm looking for something to knock my socks off, the kind of heat level that you sort of regret having put in your mouth after doing so. This is not it.  Even ten drops of the stuff in a sauce on my own plate doesn't do much for me.  So I wont be ordering this again.<br /><br />(UPDATE - getting near the end of the bottle now, and I have to say taste-wise, I'm starting to quite like it.  However, I don't like it enough to pay the Amazon shipping fees, and it's not sold in any supermarkets near me, so I doubt I will be ordering this again.  Suggestion to the makers, if they ever read these comments: dispense with the labelling which makes it seem like a rival to the "Dave's" line of hot sauces when it blatantly isn't, and just market it on the basis of the taste.)
