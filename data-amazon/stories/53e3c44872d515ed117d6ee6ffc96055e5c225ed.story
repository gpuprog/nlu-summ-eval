I was an avid fan of the Lavazza Cafe Espresso (black can) for years.  I was about to sign up for the subscription service for this product on Amazon.com when I started reading the reviews about the Lavazza Crema e Gusto. One of my main concerns is if the acid in a coffee will give me an upset stomach.  The Cafe Espresso didn't at all, so I was leery to switch to something else.  I figured I'd give the Crema e Gusto a try and if it was too much for my stomach, I'd switch back.  No worries.  Not only is this a smooth blend, it has a richer taste than the Cafe Espresso.  I won't need to switch back!
