I gave my dog a Bravo bully stick today and he just threw it up after much gagging etc. It's not like any Bravo stick I've ever seen. He threw up big pieces that looked like they were finely cut with a sharp knife. Almost as if it were knife cut segments that were glued together.This should not happen with a Bravo stick. I will never buy a bully stick from this retailer at Amazon again. I question if this really is a Bravo product. It does not appear to be natural. After 8 hrs in his stomach it is totally undigested.
