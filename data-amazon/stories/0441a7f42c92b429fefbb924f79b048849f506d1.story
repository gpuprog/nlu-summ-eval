My Shih Tzu is seven and has had one Greenie a day for years.  She is happy, healthy and has great teeth.  She begs for her Greenie every morning.  Don't worry about Greenies causing allergies!  The main source of allergies is CORN in dog food.  Do your little one a favor and go to a grain free or reduced grain dog food.  When you think about it, wild dogs didn't eat corn meal!  If your little one has allergies, you will be amazed at the immediate healing.
