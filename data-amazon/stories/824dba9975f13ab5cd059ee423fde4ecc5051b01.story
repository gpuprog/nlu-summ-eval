I got this bag in the mail and the first thing I noticed is that these clusters were more like tiny cereal bits, which I assume is being bounced around in the mail.  Second, my bag came with a hole in it, which I guess didn't affect the overall quality of the clusters. I feel these are two things a consumer needs to know about buying this item via the mail.  Other than that, the taste of the blend is pretty good.  I had it by itself, with milk and as a topping on my oatmeal and it tasted very good.  The fruit flavor is natural and sweet with the vanilla taste warm and inviting underneath.  All the ingredients are pretty wholesome for the most part, except for cane sugar, but at least that is a natural, non-processed sugar.  I feel the packs are overpriced for what they are.  My boyfriend and I ate the pack I got very fast, to account for how good the product is.  But we do make similar clusters as a snack in our home for a lot cheaper.  The Kind comes out to about 50 cents an ounce and I can make a great deal more of a honey/almond/fruit clusters for that much.  Even if I added flax seed and quinoa.  But needless to say, I really like the product a lot and if I had the money to spend $5.38 for a pack, I would.  It just is a bit high in price for my meager budget!

If you get it in the mail, the clusters will be broken down...
