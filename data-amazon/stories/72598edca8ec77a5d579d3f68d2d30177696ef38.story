For anyone who does any cooking that involves poppy seeds, it makes total sense to buy in semi-bulk.<br /><br />For the cost of two pounds of these high quality Frontier seeds, you might be able to buy a few ounces (2-3 bottles) from your local grocery store.<br /><br />There are many great recipes from Eastern Europe that use lots and lots of these tasty seeds.  I haven't bothered trying to buy in super-bulk yet, like the 70 lbs bags!  But I might in the near future :)<br /><br />I should offer a warning to people who are subjected to random urinalyses: at work, in the military or on probation: some of the recipes that call for a large amounts of poppy seeds (like Hungarian "Beiglis") can cause a positive result for opiate use.<br /><br />I run these tests for people in my department and for some employees, it can cause serious problems, so please be careful!  I unofficially tested myself after eating a Czech Kolache, and my pee was positive for opiates for four days!! (using the OPI2000 indicator kit)<br /><br />Probably best not to bring these dishes in to work and share them with your co-workers!  They covered this on Myth-Busters I heard, and its absolutely true.
