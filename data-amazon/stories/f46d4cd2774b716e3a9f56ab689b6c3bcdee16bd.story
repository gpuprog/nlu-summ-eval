I am a long time diabetic and always looking for a sweet treat without all the sugar. I've always enjoyed Haribo gummies, so I tried their sugar free version and WOW. You can't tell the difference. They are still sweet and fruity and smell just the same. As a matter of fact, so good, me kids ate almost all them. Not many candies I enjoy that are sugar free, but these are the ticket.
