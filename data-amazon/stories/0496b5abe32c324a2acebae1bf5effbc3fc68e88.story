Wow!  This was a surprise.  While the other reviews tempted me to try it... and i figured my kids would love it (anything with chocolate and peanutbutter is a winner)... i was mightily surprised to find that all the adults ate it before the kids could get any.<br /><br />Very easy to prepare and a quick, light (if you leave off the topping and the crust) dessert that goes great after a pork meal.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for offering it!  i HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who enjoys a reeses cup.
