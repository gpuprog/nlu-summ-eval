Mighty Leaf Green Tea Tropical tea is my favorite tea ever. I had a really hard time finding it this summer after having many local stores carry it in stock for the past few years. I turned to Amazon and found it available and less expensive if I order over $25.00 and get the free shipping. Not a problem! Now I order 3 packs at a time (9 boxes) and have 3-4 cups a day. Thank you Mighty Leaf and thank you Amazon!
