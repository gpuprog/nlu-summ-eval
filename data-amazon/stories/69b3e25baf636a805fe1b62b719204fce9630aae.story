I really like the taste of this organic rooibos tea. The leaves are a bit small but works wonderfully if you infuse it using a french press, instead of using a meshed ball tea infuser.<br /><br />I'm from South Africa and even thought I know people there like it with milk, I would recommend it without milk, probably personal taste.<br /><br />It's a wonderful healthy alternative to any hot caffeine drink. enjoy.
