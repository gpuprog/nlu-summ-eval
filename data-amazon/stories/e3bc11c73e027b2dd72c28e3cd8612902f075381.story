I am a chocolate expert, and expected more of this chocolate than I got. It was poorly stored, so the chocolate is brittle and the cocoa butter has risen to the surface, so it's no good for nibbling, but when you melt it, i.e. for baking, it is much better. All low notes (no fruit or floral notes) makes for a chocolate that you should not use by itself in baking, it just doesn't have enough complexity. But mixed with other chocolates it will provide solid support.
