I have had my Keurig for ten days now.  Since I was waiting for my Amazon-ordered Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf to arrive via Fed Ex, I was using the free variety sampler pack that came with the machine.  I was certain that the whole Keurig thing was hype.  The coffee was weak.  The coffee was fruity-winy, just what I dislike in my coffee mug.  I had even tried the hot chocolate and thought it was about the same as Swiss Miss in an envelope:  crappy-tasting and limpid.  Last night, things started to look up:  I had a Celestial Seasonings Mandarin Spice herbal tea, and that was verrrry good.  And today, my Dark Magic arrived.  Just had two cups.  It's dark.  It's rich.  It's bold.  It's smooth.  It accepts my half-and-half and stands up to it.  It's a heckuva cup of coffee.  Maybe I'll keep the Keurig after all.

Finally, a reason to keep the Keurig!
