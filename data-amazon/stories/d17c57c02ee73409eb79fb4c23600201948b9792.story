I love these cookies!!<br /><br />But when I received my 6 pack from Amazon, they were slightly off in crispness and flavor.  They still had 4 months before they expired, WTH!<br /><br />I wrote a letter to Almondina suggesting the re-evaluate their freshness calculation.  They responded that they do not sell to Amazon, so they could not comment on any product handling that may have impacted their product's flavor, crispness or freshness.  They offered to replace my cookies.  Which I thought was excellent customer service.  I will buy my Almondinas directly from their website in the future.
