You should Google the toxic effects of oils when they are heated to their smoke point. I used to think fried food was just fatty - now I know it's also toxic. That research led me to take note of the smoke points of the various oils I use when cooking and make sure I don't reach them. I try to only use healthy oils and use them properly:<br /><br />Coconut Oil - smoke point: 350-400 degrees F<br />Olive Oil - smoke point: 350-400 degrees F<br />Avocado Oil - smoke point: 520 degrees F<br /><br />The smoke point of most common oils is around 350-400 degrees F - depending on the specific type/process used to create the oil. As a result, it's pretty easy to reach those smoke points and create toxins in your food.<br /><br />Avocado oil has a very high smoke point (520 degrees F). It also has a fatty profile similar to olive oil (healthy in moderation). This makes it an ideal substitute to whatever you were using to cook things at high heat. For me this means any time I cook meat in my cast iron skillet (high heat to get a nice sear). The avocado flavor is very mild and is not something you will taste in the finished product.<br /><br />I've been using this product for a few months...<br /><br />EDIT: It just dawned on me that this product is in a can. While the oil itself has been great, I cannot continue buying anything in a can. I have been phasing canned items out of my kitchen to avoid BPA. Even BPA-free cans have to have some replacement chemical lining the aluminum to prevent corrosion. As such I am dropping this rating down to 4 stars and will look for other options. I even prefer plastic over cans but glass is best!

Avocado oil - a great replacement for olive oil in high heat situations!
