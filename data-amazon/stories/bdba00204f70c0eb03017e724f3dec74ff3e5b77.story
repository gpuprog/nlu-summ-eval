So I bought this thing and my cockapoo wouldn't touch it, I played with her with it and tried to show her how it worked and even rubbed cheese on it, but she never figured it out.  So I got the idea that I could take a empty 20 oz coke bottle and fill it half way with kibble and maybe she would graduate to the tug a jug eventually.  Well, she loves the plastic soda bottles, but still ignores this toy.  I think maybe it is because they replaced the rope with a rubber faux rope.  She loves her rope toys, but doesn't like this rubber rope.  I recommend starting with a soda bottle and only moving to this if they regularly destroy the soda bottle.

Use a Plastic Coke Bottle Instead
