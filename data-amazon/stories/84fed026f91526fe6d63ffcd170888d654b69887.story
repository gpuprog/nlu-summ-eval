This taste delicious. I love the spiciness. Sometimes I eat  2 packets a day. I'm craving it right now! I can't have any until I get back to the U.S.A :(<br /><br />My only complained is the high sodium levels.<br /><br />I've tried the shrimp mama brand in Australia, but it's just not the same. The Australian one is more creamy.
