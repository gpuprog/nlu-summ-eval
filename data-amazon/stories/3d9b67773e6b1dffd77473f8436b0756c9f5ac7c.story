I have tried the unsalted thin and crispy. They are excellent.<br /><br />We have also tried the chesse poofs and cheese curls which are glutten free.<br />For themto be gluten free and taste so good. Our kids love the taste.<br /><br />Espcially now that they are on a special glutten fre diet.... those cheese puffs have become there favorite.<br /><br />Excellent  food choice.
