The item was exactly what I was looking for and I was thrilled to receive it. However, since Id only ever bought this specific candy in Germany, I assumed that they were shipping from overseas which is why I was willing to pay the rediculous shipping cost. I was surprised to see that that was not at all the case. The item shipped from within the continental US. Ive purchased a lot of stuff online and I think this was the highest Ive ever had to pay for shipping. Maybe the seller incurs a lot of import fees and that could raise the price that they charge for shipping but I still think that almost three times the price of the actual item is again, rediculous.
