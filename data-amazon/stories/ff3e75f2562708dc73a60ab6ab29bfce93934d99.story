Good company, but the product is not necessary.  Just put whole oats into a normal blender/osterizer and run on high speed until it is powderized.  Thiis product costs quite a lot more than regular oatmeal.  When baking with this item, the cookies are esxtremely dry and mealy.<br /><br />Nothing personal, guys, just the facts.
