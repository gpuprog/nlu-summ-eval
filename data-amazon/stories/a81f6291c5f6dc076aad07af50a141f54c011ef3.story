This is my absolute favorite protein mix. I mix one scoop with 8oz of really cold milk and just sit back and enjoy. It almost reminds me of coffee ice cream. You can actually use this stuff in ice cream to make a less sugar/higher protein treat. You can bake with it as well. You can drink it hot or cold. There are so many different flavors that can come of it when you use flavored syrups. Bariatric friendly, for sure. 2 years post gastric bypass and no negative effects.
