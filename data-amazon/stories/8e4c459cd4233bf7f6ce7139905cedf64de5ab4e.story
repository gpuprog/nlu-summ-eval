I had the opportunity to go tea tasting (similar to wine tasting) and try many different varieties of tea and discovered Oolong to be my absolute favorite tea.  I tried Twining's Oolong slightly skeptical since it is not loose tea.  As it turns out this was a wonderful tea.  I buy several boxes at once so I can enjoy at work, home etc.<br /><br />The flavor and texture are velvet smooth, slightly sweet (even without sugar) and rich.  It is definitely not a thin or watery tea like many other teas can be.  This tea creates a sense of peace for me as I drink it.  I especially love to drink this tea on my deck looking out over my wooded back yard.
