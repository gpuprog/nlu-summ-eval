My wife (a real lemon lover) and I are very happy with this.  It is the closest thing to real lemon juice that I've ever had.  It has none of the off taste of concentrated lemon juice.  In my iced tea or in plain water I cannot tell that it's not from a real lemon.  I've never done an side-by test taste and would not be surprised if I could tell the difference then, but just using it as I do I don't notice any difference.

Surprisingly good and authentic tasing
