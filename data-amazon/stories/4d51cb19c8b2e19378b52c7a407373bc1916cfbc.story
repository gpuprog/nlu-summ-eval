I often have something in the fridge but incomplete without a starch. In addition, I am usually in the middle of something and can't stop.<br /><br />This rice fought the hungries for me last week when lunch was 3 hours past due. I added some leftover turkey, SW spices, a can of tomatoes and had an improvised Spanish rice. The garlic flavor was a bonus which concerned me when considering the order.<br /><br />I enjoyed the meal, albeit not home-cooked but cheaper than takeout and healthier than snacks. The Subscribe and Save program is a real benefit to me since I live over 20 miles to the nearest grocery store and save time and money by using it. Amazon to the rescue--again!
