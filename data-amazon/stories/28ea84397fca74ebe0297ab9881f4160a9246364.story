We really enjoy Stash teas and saw the sampler as an excellent way to try new flavors, most of which are not available in any of our local stores.  We enjoyed most of the flavors - and have found a new favorite, blueberry.  The aroma and flavor is just like fresh blueberries!  The flavor intensity varies greatly between flavors, which can be a good way to find a flavor to suit your mood.  The ginger, however, was just too strong and burned my taste buds.  I also enjoy Bigelow teas and would agree with another reviewer that some of the Stash flavors (little under half) are mild in comparison.  However, there are times when a gentle chamomile is just what I need.  I probably won't purchase another variety pack, but will purchase our new favorite flavors separately.  I recommend this to anybody looking to experiment with new flavors; Stash has some wonderfully original tastes.
