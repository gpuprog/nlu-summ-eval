What an interesting treat! Yes, you may feel the flavor of raw cacao, but this aspect is mild, and you may not even notice it if you don't focus on it. What you are more likely to notice is how elegantly it's crafted in terms of mouthfeel (both the chocolate itself and the combination of the chocolate and the filling). I think this product is a masterpiece, taste-wise and texture-wise. The only obstacles for my family to buying from this brand often are the price and the presence of some added sugar (relatively little though, judging by the numbers on their labels; I just wanted to point out that agave nectar is especially high in fructose, the "worst" of "simple sugars", and this brand uses some agave nectar - hopefully very little).<br /><br />The name is misleading though - I can't feel "caramel" no matter how hard I stretch my imagination. It's delicious, just don't expect that dairy flavor.<br />This brand's other bars, Acai and Goji, are similar, but "Maca" is NOT chocolaty and disappointing.

Very creative! (but "caramel" isn't the best name for it)
