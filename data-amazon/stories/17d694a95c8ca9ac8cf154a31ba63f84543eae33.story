We were switching from Hills Science RD dry to Instinct Grain-Free Salmon. We were mixing 1/4 of Salmon to 3/4 of RD for about a week and then went to 1/2 to 1/2. Our dog liked both foods, but it caused real bad diarrhea and bleeding and vomiting. Our vet had put our dog on medication and took us off of the Salmon. We have given the rest of the bag away to someone who's dog can use it.<br />We have never had a problem with switchning to new food in the past.
