no words for taste, it has its own taste. Some like it, some doesn't. Even I don't prefer too. I  saw a  awesome deal posted in some deal site and ordered it. The seller is crappy, holding the item for a month, even not sure s/he will send this. Some ebayer in amazon too. Like amazon store is now in amazon forest.
