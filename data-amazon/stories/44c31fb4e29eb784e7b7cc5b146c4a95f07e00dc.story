Finally got tired of trying to find Yuzu Juice to buy nearby - best price was the three bottle option, figuring it would require refrigeration once opened, researched shelf life - 4 months in frig, one or more year unopened on shelf - figured this would work.<br />Boy was I WRONG.  Product arrived with expiration on all three bottles in less than 6 weeks.  Ridiculous.  Returning asap.  Too bad Amazon does not include this kind of information on their listing.
