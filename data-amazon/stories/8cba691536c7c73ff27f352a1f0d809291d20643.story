Hands down, the best new snack I've tried in years!  Seriously, I will be ordering more of these immediately, as these did not last long around my house...<br /><br />These are crispy, with a great (but not bitter) punch of cocoa powder in every bite.  The sesame seeds add a great flavor to them as well -- these are just such a perfect snack when you want something sort of like a chip, but also have a sweet tooth.  Love them!  So did everyone who tried them.  I would give these 6 stars if I could!
