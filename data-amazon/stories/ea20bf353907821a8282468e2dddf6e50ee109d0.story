I've been searching for a great gluten free bread for the last two years. No luck. An associate at Trader Joes told me that this bread was probably the best Gluten Free in the store. I tried it. It was small slices and hard. I put the slices in the microwave for 19 seconds. After I took it out, the bread felt super soft. I made a turkey sandwhich and the bread tatse like regular bread nearly. I was so shocked at how amazing the bread taste.<br /><br />I will continue to buy but keep looking for the perfect gluten free bread. If the slices were a little bigger and I did not have to heat the bread before using, this would be the perfect bread.
