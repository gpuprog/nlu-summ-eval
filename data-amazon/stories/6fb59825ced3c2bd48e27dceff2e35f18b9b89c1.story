While I agree this is shipped in a nice wooden box that can be used for other things and the fish has an excellent flavor, I was surprised to find it was not what I expected.  I expected smoked lox salmon like you find at a good deli or grocery store, not fully cooked salmon as this actually is.  For those expecting the latter, this is a great product, however this is not for me as it was smoked (or cooked) too long.
