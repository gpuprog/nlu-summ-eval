I may have gotten a bad batch, but these tasted stale to me. I'm also frustrated with poor marketing. Is this a cereal, or a snack? If it's meant to just be a snack, it falls very short. There were few actual clusters,and the rest was loose bits of grain, etc. That could have worked in milk with a spoon, but the packaging seemed to indicate it's a snack food. I have no idea what's 'kind' about it, and I don't like the push for grains to be considered 'required' in anyone's diet. The original studies that showed fiber was important for digestion were all studies on VEGETABLE fibers in real whole foods, not in processed grains. They're doing good by using only non GMO ingredients, but still not what I consider to be truly healthy food.
