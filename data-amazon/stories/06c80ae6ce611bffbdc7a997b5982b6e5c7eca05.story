I brew espresso on great equipment at work. I normally use Peet's Espresso Forte, which is better, but much more expensive. My bag had shiny, dark beans with a pleasant aroma. The espresso isn't as strong as I'm used to, but isn't offensive. It will take me a while to use 2 pounds; I expect that I'll go back to buying 1/4 lb weekly instead.
