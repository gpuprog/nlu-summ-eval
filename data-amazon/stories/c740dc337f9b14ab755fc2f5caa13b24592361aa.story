WOOOO  BABY!!!!  Frank's Red Hot is what keeps me going when I fear I can go no more!  Who cares about coffee?  It stains teeth!  I just drink one of these babies every morning and I am good to go!  When I'm having a bad day, I drink it.  When my boyfriend breaks up with me, I drink it.  When a bird poops on my head, I drink it. When I accidentally spill it all over my pants while giving an important speech to the board members of a prestigious company, guess what I do??  I DRINK IT!!!!!!!!  Also, it is good to throw in the faces of your enemies.  Their faces will not be able to withstand the awesomeness of it and they will run away in fear.  Overall, I would recommend Frank's Red Hot Cayenne Pepper Sauce- 1 gal. as a go-to product for any living organism looking for a good time, as it can be used as anything from a weapon, to a cleaning supply, or an anniversary present.
