So this water seems to have a lot of hype surrounding it with added PH and electrolytes for flavor along with lots of other beneficial extras. However I'm not to sure how impressed I am with it overall.<br />The water itself seems to have a filmy taste to it although my kids didn't seem to notice,if the water is chilled its somewhat less noticeable. The price for 12, 1.5 liter bottles seems to fluctuate quiet a bit on here since the price yesterday was double what it is today. The size of the bottle is nice especially for a work environment so you don't have to get up as much for refills.<br />As far as this water is concerned  I think ill just stick to tap water or something like mountain spring bottled water instead.
