If you haven't tried these cookies with a glass of milk, you haven't lived!  I bought them in a small grocery in Washington, DC while I was there on business.  I saved the wrapper, googled them and then bought them through Amazon.  Quick service, product was fresh and now I am happy.  Caution, they are addicting so only let yourself have one or two at a time - not the whole box.
