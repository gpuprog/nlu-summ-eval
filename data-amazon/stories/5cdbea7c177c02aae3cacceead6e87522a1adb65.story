I bought these as a goof as they reminded me of when I was a kid and whenever I give one to a friend it starts a whole conversation about when we were growing up and you would buy them in a candy store and we just laugh about the old days.  Only problem I found is many of the packages are filled with green and purple my two least favorite flavors but aside from that also that they are packaged individually in the summer is great I keep a package with me all the time
