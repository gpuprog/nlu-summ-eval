As much of a tea fanatic as I consider myself, I'd never heard of guayasa before running into the Runa brand. Now that I have, I could see myself buying it over and over again! It has a full-bodied flavor without the bitter aftertaste of some black teas. It's earthy without being heavy-handed or overpowering, completely unique from any other tea I've tasted. You won't find tea like this anywhere else. And though the product speaks for itself, the business model of this brand doesn't hurt: Runa buys guayusa directly from local farmers in Ecuador at fair-trade prices. Try it! It's worth every cent :)
