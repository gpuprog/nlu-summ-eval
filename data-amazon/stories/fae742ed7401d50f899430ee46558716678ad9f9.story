First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats
