These appear to be pretty healthy online but after the taste test I am probably going to stop the auto-ship function as they are too sweet, especially for a "healthy" snack. Sugar and Glucose in the cranberry bars and honey and Glucose in the almond & coconut. Don't get me wrong, they are pretty tasty and somewhat healthy but just a little too sweet for me. knock some of the sugar out and it would be an excellent health snack.
