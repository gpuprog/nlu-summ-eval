I love this stuff. I had always been a major eater of salt. I put salt, and lots of it on most everything. About a year ago I was put on a low sodium diet. This was a real shock. I could barely eat most things and didn't enjoy anything. I lost 40 lbs in the first two months. The Roland glaze's are one of the items that made eating tolerable and even enjoyable. I have all the flavors and like them all. If I were forced to pick a favorite it would probably be ginger. By the way the other products that have helped with my diet are Chef Jimmy's My Mojo(a huge flavor boost for a modest amount of sodium,) Kernel Seasons Barbecue Popcorn Seasoning and Kayoda Sesame Oil. I have even gained back about 15 pounds.
