This stuff rocks! Yeah, it has a little apple cider vinegar taste but I like it. The flavor is not overwhelming and it's a healthy, clean and refreshing drink. It is almost impossible to find good-tasting bottled drinks with ZERO CARBS that taste good and don't have aspartame or Splenda in them.  The other Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar drinks have carbs in them but this Ginger Spice flavor is ZERO. This one is a keeper for me. On a hot day it's just perfect and it doesn't affect my weight or my blood sugar.
