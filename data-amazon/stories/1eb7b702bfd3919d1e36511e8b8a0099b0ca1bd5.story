I look forward to cooking in the microwave...means no spattered stove to clean! BIG SURPRISE - no microwave directions. Well this will be a noble experiment because it will be microwaved! Called Miss Betty Crocker @ General Mills and they don't supply microwaved directions either. So wish me luck as I experiment!<br /><br />UPDATE: Found Microwave directions on web BUT you still have to experiment :(<br /><br />MICROWAVE DIRECTIONS<br />1. Crumble 1 lb lean ground beef into 3-qt microwavable casserole or bowl. Microwave uncovered on High 3 to 5 minutes, breaking up beef after 3 minutes, until brown; drain.<br />2. Stir in sauce mix, 2-2/3 cups boiling water, 1 cup milk and uncooked potatoes.<br />3. Microwave uncovered on High 14 to 21 minutes, stirring every 7 minutes, until potatoes are tender (sauce will thicken as it stands). Dish will be hot. Meanwhile, stir 1/4 cup milk and toping mix in bowl 30 seconds; set aside.<br />4. Pour topping over beef mixture. (If topping is too thick to pour, stir in an additional 1/2 to 1 tsp milk.)<br /><br />***High altitude microwave (3500-6500 ft): increase boiling water to 3 cups and last microwave time to 18-25 min.
