I can believe the source material used for this extract may have, by some miracle, exhibited strawberry genes...  But that's as far as I'm willing to admit that this has any strawberry flavor at all.<br /><br />What came labeled as strawberry extract tasted more like equal parts of:<br /><br />- Vanilla<br />- Burnt wood<br /><br />Nope, not only is this not suitable as strawberry flavor, it's not worth the bottle it came in either.
