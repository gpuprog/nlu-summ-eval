The picture shows a gourd that would likely hold somewhere around 12 oz of fluid roughly, maybe more. The gourd that I received is no bigger than a pool cue. The bombilla straw looks good on the other hand. It's made of metal. I haven't tried the yerba mate yet but it is fresh for another year according to the exp date.
