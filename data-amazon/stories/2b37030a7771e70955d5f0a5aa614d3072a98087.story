This is definitely the best coconut milk I can find.  I especially like the organic version.  The other brand referred to in these reviews is chemically altered. They add water and preserve it with sulfites - toxic and I'm allergic to them.  Also, when you buy a 'lite' version of coconut milk, you are just paying for the company to water it down for you.  You can add your own water at home if you don't like as much fat.  But this is healthy fat (which can help you lose weight-study Dr. Young's New Biology) and coconuts are so good for you, especially the green/young ones.
