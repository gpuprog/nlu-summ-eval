One of my biggest concerns when told I was gluten intolerant was the possible exclusion of comfort food. Let me tell you, this is almost as good as Kraft Mac & Cheese dinner (mind you, the concession) ...The transition in diet was made much easier when I discovered Annie's product. Not only is it Gluten free, but I can make it with my own Lactose-free milk! I can't say I've been easy to adjust to my new diet, but Annie's makes it so much more bearable. I'm down to 3 times a week with this, but I'd easily consume it more. ...Don't know if they do, but if they offered other pastas, I'd be happy to try them with my own sauce!
