Good dark chocolate. Don't know if it's any better or worse than equivalent chocolate bars or non-organic chocolate.<br /><br />I guess I can say it didn't leave the kind of burnt or unpleasant aftertaste that I've noticed some other name brand chocolates occasionally do. So, there's that.<br /><br />For me, it was just generally some pleasant dark chocolate.
