I live outside the US where it is almost impossible to find a good Mexican restaurant. I love Mexican and Tex-Mex foods. I was overcome by a craving so I ordered these, a holdover from my childhood when my tastes were less culinary. They are bland but they can be doctored up with cheese, salsa, onions, peppers and whatever else one would like. They are good to have around as filling comfort food.
