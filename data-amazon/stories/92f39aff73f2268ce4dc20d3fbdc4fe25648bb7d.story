I took a chance with this product (even though there weren't enough good reviews) since they are cheaper than 5 hour energy.  They did not work for me so I tried Red Rain which did work and was even cheaper.  Red Rain DID work for me so I am done with 5 hour energy and 6 hour power. The ingredients are pretty close to 5 hour energy but someone is lying since it doesn't work.
