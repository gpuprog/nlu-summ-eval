I purchased this due the price point of the subscription service. I use coconut milk primarily for cooking curries. I found this one to be watery and not as good as others I've used (primary chaokoh). It was useable for cooking but I prefer a thicker, richer milk. I would not buy it again.

Not the best quality but tolerable.
