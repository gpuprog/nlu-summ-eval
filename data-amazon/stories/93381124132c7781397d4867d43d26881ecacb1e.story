My order arrived in a big cardboard box. The bags were just placed in the box and shipped. No plastic cover or anything to protect the bags from insects, moisture, dust, etc. I'm pleased with the product but not the packaging. Amazon does not provide any ingredients or nutritional information about this product, so I will. Here we go.<br /><br />Ingredients: Corn Masa Flour, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Salt, Trace of Lime.

Very good tortilla strips but packaging is poor.
