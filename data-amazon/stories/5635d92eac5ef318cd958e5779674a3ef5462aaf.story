Got the health and mana potions for my son-- a wow enthusiast.  He thinks they taste weird-- I think they taste better than most energy drinks, but that's a matter of opinion...<br />He was shocked to pull them from his stocking and I got instant "Cool Mom" points-- so I was very happy.<br />They are great for the novelty though I wouldn't pay the exorbitant price and shipping and handling to get them again...
