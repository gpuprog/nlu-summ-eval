I eat very little candy, but every once in a while I can't resist. Well, sometimes I'll try a candy substitute and on my last trip to the grocery store, I spotted some bags (2.75 ounces) of Werther's Original Hard Candies (Sugar Free). They're very low in calories. Okay, are they any good? Well, they taste a little like a very weak creamy caramel hard candy. I tired of them after the third one. They have a bit of an illusion of candy, but just don't match up. I doubt that I'll finish the bag. Oh well, maybe it's for the best.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Low in Calories. Weak Caramel Taste, Sorta.
