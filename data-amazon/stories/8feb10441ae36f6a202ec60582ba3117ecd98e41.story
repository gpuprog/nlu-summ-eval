I just can't face black coffee but regular coffee creamers are so full of calories and fat. Even if you get the sugar-free kind you are still ingesting a whopping 1gm of fat PER TABLESPOON! Also the flavored creamers use hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated fats.<br />Rather than being a creamer, this flavors/sweetens your coffee. Many times I've found that things sweetened with Splenda are too sweet but that's not the case here. It adds a subtle sweetness, not overpowering at all. If you need it creamy, just add a splash of fat-free half and half or better yet, a tablespoon of non-fat powdered milk or a tsp of fat-free evaporated milk.<br />Even if you're not on a diet this is a great alternative to white sugar or fatty creamers.
