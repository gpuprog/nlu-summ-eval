I bought this as a treat for my business partner and me because we were always leaving the office and spending lots of "our bucks" and Starbucks! When I initially set it up, I found it very easy to figure out and was especially pleased with the quality of the shots that were coming out. Nice rich crema and very hot! Of course the flavor is all in the coffee you buy. You can put to large coffee cups underneath to brew to cups at once which is nice.  I also love that you can adjust the grind and amount of coffee per shot. Sometimes you want it strong, sometimes just a regular cup of coffee strength is nice too.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed that you can't change out the coffee beans once you fill the grinder. Not a big deal but it would have been an option I would have chosen in a machine if I had known. I'm also not that thrilled with the plastic build. I know it's hard to find things that aren't made of plastic at a good price, but this one is just a little too "plasticky" in it's appearance.<br /><br />Now the big gripe - the steaming wand! It worked pretty well, although it seemed to take about a minute to froth a pitcher of milk. When I took it off to clean it thoroughly, it never quite fit right again and would constantly pop off mid-steam. I would adjust it it and adjust it but to no avail, it would keep popping off.  I found an OEM replacement for it here - [...] and now it works like A DREAM! Consistently frothy milk in less than 30 seconds! I don't know why they didn't make this the wand that is included, but it made the difference between almost sending this thing back to bragging about it to everyone I know! If you already own this machine, definitely spend the 18 bucks to buy the new wand and you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />In conclusion, I bought this espresso machine because of the price point. Amazon had the best price I could find! I don't think I would buy this one again, but I would definitely buy a Saeco. After much research, people are always pleased with Saeco and I would have to say, other than that pesky wand, I am pleased with this machine's ability to perform daily and consistently offering up rich espresso with great crema. Next time, I would buy one that allowed me to switch out the coffee and perhaps one that was a little more attractive.

Great little machine except for the steaming wand!
