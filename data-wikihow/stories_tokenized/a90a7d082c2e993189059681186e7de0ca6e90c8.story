Once you have marked the point on the wall , have your child move aside so you can measure their height . Extend the measuring tape from the point you have marked to the floor and write down the measurement . This dimension is the height of your toddler.Keep in mind that kid 's bikes are measured by the size of the wheels , not the frame height . Bikes for toddlers usually range from 12 and 16 inches .

In general , 12-inch wheels are designed for children 36-40 inches tall , 16-inch wheels are for children 41-49 inches tall , and 20-inch wheels are for children 50-56 inches tall .
