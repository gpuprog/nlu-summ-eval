Although you can technically reupholster furniture with any kind of fabric , most fabrics wo n't be thick and sturdy enough to last for many years . Look for special upholstering fabric , which is thicker and made to stand against wear-and-tear better than other types of fabric . Keep in mind that the type of furniture you use will depend on the placement of the piece ; you can get away with using regular fabric on a piece of furniture that wo n't be frequently used , but you 'll definitely need upholstering fabric for pieces that are used often -LRB- like a couch -RRB- . Because reupholstering is such a time-consuming process , try to select a fabric that is relatively neutral and will stand the test of time in terms of style . That way , it will fit with your interior design preferences for more time than a bold or trendy fabric choice would .

If you get a patterned fabric , try to choose one that wo n't require you to match specific sections of the pattern -LRB- like wallpaper -RRB- when you cut it into sections . You can still use a cut-specific pattern like this , but it will take much more time trying to lay the pattern out so that each piece is going the same direction as all the other pieces .
