Switch to a zipper foot , then machine stitch the lining around the zipper .





Sew from top to bottom on the left side of the zipper and from bottom to top on the right side . Make sure that you do not get too close to the bumps of the zipper while working .

Alternatively , you could hand stitch the lining to the zipper if you do not have a zipper foot . Use a fell stitch or similarly secure stitch .
