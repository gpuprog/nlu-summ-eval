The owner comes home four minutes into each round -LRB- or earlier if the alarm is set off -RRB- . The clock will chime at about two minutes in , allowing you to judge what you can and should do in the remaining time .





Holding an item in front of you and/or crouching will sometimes hide you from the owner , and he will go away .
