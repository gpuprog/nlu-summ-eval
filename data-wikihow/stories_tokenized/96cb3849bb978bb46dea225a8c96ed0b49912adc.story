Does the guinea pig sound like they are breathing heavy or gasping for air ? Respiratory problems are extremely common for guinea pigs.If the guinea pig is breathing very heavily then seek immediate attention by a veterinarian .

Notice if the guinea pig is sneezing , has discharge around the eyes , and/or has a runny nose . These are all signs of a respiratory infection and require quick attention by a veterinarian within 24 hours .
