The effectiveness of an inventory system is heavily dependent on the accuracy with which the items being inventoried are counted . Inaccurate counting of products or merchandise often causes discrepancies in accounting , sales tracking , over-ordering and over-production , among other issues . An inefficient storage system also will significantly affect the cost of tracking inventory by increasing the amount of time taken to complete the process.Focus on making your inventory easy to access , separate , and count . Work on providing visibility , ease of labeling , and simple organization so that your counters can quickly access each item. ;
