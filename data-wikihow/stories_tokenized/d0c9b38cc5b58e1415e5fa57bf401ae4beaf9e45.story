Before the date do something that relaxes you , exercise , reading , yoga , singing your favorite song , whatever puts you in an easy going , happy mood . Wash yourself , put on antiperspirant/deodorant , brush your teeth , brush your hair , and do n't forget to wear clean clothes ! Make a list of conversation starters and questions you can ask them if you 're having trouble finding a topic . Questions about their pet -LRB- s -RRB- , taste in music , good books they 've read lately , favorite thing to do outdoors , would you rather questions , are all good ideas . Remember these and read the front page of the newspaper , too. ;
