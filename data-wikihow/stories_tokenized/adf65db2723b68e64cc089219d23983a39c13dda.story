Change your bandages every 24-48 hours , or if they get wet . A few drops of urine can be overlooked , but liquid that saturates through the bandage will be cause for a new dressing . Apply a small amount of vaseline to the glans and shaft of the penis to prevent the bandage from sticking to the skin .
