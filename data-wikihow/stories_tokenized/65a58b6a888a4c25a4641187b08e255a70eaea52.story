Being single means that you have more time for yourself . Now is the time to develop your own interests outside of work and other relationships . Pursue what makes you happy , what fulfills you , or what piques your curiosity . Do n't let your work or other people influence which interest you pursue . Choose something that will bring you joy or fulfillment.You might take up bike riding , or yoga , or a book club , or even sign up for sewing lessons at a local shop .
