While you may not feel as though you have done anything wrong , there is a chance that you are missing a key piece of information or instructions in your coursework . Asking your teacher will show that you are willing to put in the effort to improve . You can ask :





'' How can I better prepare for your class ? ''

`` How can I improve my essays ? ''

`` What am I missing when I turn in my assignments ? ''
