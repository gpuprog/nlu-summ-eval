Remember that sinks should be much thicker then most of the pots you have ever made . You probably will need about 6-9 kg -LRB- 13.2-19 .8 lb -RRB- of clay for a 30 cm -LRB- 12 in -RRB- external diameter sink or 12-15kg -LRB- 26.4-33 lb -RRB- for 42 cm -LRB- 16Â 7/8 in -RRB- diameter sink . The quantity of clay depends on the sink type . Vessel sinks need to be thicker than drop-down sinks .
