Be careful because one bolt that is easier to see looks like it may be one to remove but its left of the correct one -RRB- and find and then loosen the water pump . Loosen it from the block by tapping it with a wooden block and a mallet hammer but if it does not come loose pretty easily -- check again for another bolt .

Remove the 4 or 5 water pump bolts which are hard to see -- -LRB- 12mm -RRB- socket -- and a medium size ratchet -LRB- called 3/8 inch drive in the USA -RRB- .
