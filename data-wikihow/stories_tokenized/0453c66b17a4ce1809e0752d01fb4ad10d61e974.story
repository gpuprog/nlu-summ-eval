Approximately three days after the mating process is complete , the fry should eat up the remainder of their egg sacks and you should see them begin to swim around slightly . At this point , you should try to lure the male away from its fry and use a soft net to lift him out of the aquarium.You should lure the male away from the fry so that you do not accidentally net and remove any of the fry .

The male has , like the female , probably sustained injury during the mating process . Therefore , you should treat its aquarium with Betamax to prevent infection .
