Massie has a really big , but really beautiful , bag . It holds a lot . Do n't bring a backpack , use your bag . Put notebooks , gum , a make up bag with a comb or brush in it , a Teen Vogue mag , an iPod if you wish , cell phone , nail polish , elastic headbands and rubber bands , bobby pins , etc. . Whatever you need !
