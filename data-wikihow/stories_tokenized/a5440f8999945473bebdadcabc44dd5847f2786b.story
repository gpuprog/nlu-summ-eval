This is the balance of the Accumulated Depreciation account associated with the asset . Using the straight-line example above , suppose you are interested in the account balance after 6 years . For each of those 6 years , a depreciation expense of $ 1000 was recorded , so the accumulated depreciation is $ 6000 . Depreciation for the other methods is calculated by repeating the described process for each year until the desired year is reached .
