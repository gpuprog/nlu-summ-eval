Do this by finding a `` multiple '' of the two denominators . An easy way to find one is to simply multiply the two denominators together . If one of the numbers multiplies into the other numbers , you may only need to multiply one of the fractions .





Ex . 3 : 3 x 5 = 15 . Both of our fractions will have a denominator of 15 .















Ex . 4 : 14 is a multiple of 7 . So all we have to do is multiply 7 by 2 to get 14 . Both of our fractions will have a denominator of 14 .
