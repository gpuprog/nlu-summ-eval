While a mandoline is often safer to use than a knife , it is still extremely sharp and can be dangerous if you do n't use it properly . Make sure to set the tool on a flat , even surface , so it does n't move around as you 're julienning the carrots.The best surface to put the mandoline on is a cutting board that is secure on your countertop so it wo n't move around either .
