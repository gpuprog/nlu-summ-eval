If you are using a pan , make sure it is a heavy duty , non-stick pan that is large enough to accommodate all of your steaks . Add med-high heat oil -LRB- like canola -RRB- to the pan and heat the oil on medium-high heat . Do n't use butter . It will brown and then burn . Do n't add the steaks until the oil is very hot .
