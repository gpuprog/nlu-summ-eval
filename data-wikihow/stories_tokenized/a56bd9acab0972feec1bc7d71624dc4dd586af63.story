Lip balm offers two benefits . The first benefit is that it makes your lips softer in the long run , thereby making them more enjoyable to kiss . The second benefit is that a flavored or scented lip balm can intensify the kiss for your partner by engaging more of his or her senses , especially if you choose the right flavor .





Sweet flavors and minty flavors are the best to choose from.Sweet flavors , like strawberry , can activate the taste buds toward the front of the tongue that respond to sweetness . As a result , when you kiss in between nibbles , your kissing partner 's sense of taste will really kick in .

Similarly , the menthol in mint flavors can cause the body 's cold receptors to kick in . When you combine this with the sensation of warm lips and warm breath , you can create a tingling sensation that can intensify the experience for both of you .
