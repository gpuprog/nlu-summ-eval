Once dried off , the host would introduce both teams -LRB- team structure and team colors will be talked about later -RRB- . He 'd go over the rules . Generally , it sounded like these rules were well rehearsed and the rules never changed from episode to episode and never dropped or changed even the simple rules . The team who won the introductory round won control of the first question . The host would generally use these lines : `` I 'm going to ask you a question , and if you do n't know the answer or think the other team has n't got a clue , you can dare them to answer it for double the dollars . But , be careful , because they can always double dare you back for four times the amount , and then you 'll have to either answer that question or take the physical challenge . '' -RRB- .
