Let the old loop slide off the end of the needle.Keep the yarn taut after each stitch to keep the loops close to the needle but not so tight that you ca n't slide the needle into the loops .



















Be careful as you slid off the cast on stitch . Make sure that only the stitch that you knit into comes off .
