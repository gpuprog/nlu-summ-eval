No matter what type of humor you decide you want to use on your crush , practice it . Comedic timing is important to any joke or antic , impressions can always use work , and sarcasm is n't easy to pull off . Try elements out of your family or practice in front of a mirror until you get it perfect . You do n't want to tell the joke `` What happens to a frog 's car when it breaks down ? It gets toad away . '' and get the punchline wrong . You wo n't be able to impress your crush if you are stumbling over your words.Practice will make you more confident when you are using your humor on your crush . She will see how sure you are of yourself and will appreciate your personality and strength of character .
