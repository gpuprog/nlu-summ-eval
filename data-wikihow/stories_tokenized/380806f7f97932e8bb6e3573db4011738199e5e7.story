The positive outcome of a bankruptcy filing is that your debts , in most cases , will be discharged . You will have what is called a `` fresh start '' and will no longer owe the debts that you had before . Your credit rating will likely take a negative drop . However , many people see their credit score actually begin to rise again soon after bankruptcy , because , with all your old debts gone , you become a better credit risk again . It is up to you not to repeat what happened before .
