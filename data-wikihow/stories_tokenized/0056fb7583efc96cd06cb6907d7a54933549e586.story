Because the other side brought the motion to compel , they will argue first . Stand quietly and listen to what they say . Write down anything you think is wrong , so that you can correct the error when you get to speak .





Also listen to the questions the judge asks . If the judge is more interested in one issue than another , you can lead off with that issue when it is your turn to speak .
