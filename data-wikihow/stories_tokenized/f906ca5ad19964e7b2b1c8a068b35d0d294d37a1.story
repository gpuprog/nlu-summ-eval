Butter contains fat , milk solids and water , whereas shortening is 100 % pure fat . Using butter in cookies -LRB- due to the water -RRB- actually creates steam during the baking process , drying your cookies slightly . Shortening will create a chewier , more tender result . If you want to replace butter with shortening in a recipe , do so with a 1-1 ratio .

Use recipes that call for shortening instead of butter .
