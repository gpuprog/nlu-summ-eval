Children have a natural sense of wonder and almost never cease to be in awe of the universe . If you want to practice humility more often , then you should make a habit of spending more time with children . They 'll help you see the world through new , youthful eyes , and you 'll be able to rediscover some of the magic you may feel that you lost because of the daily grind . Making a habit of spending more time with kids , whether you spend more time with your own , volunteer with children , or help a friend out by babysitting , can help you practice humility regularly .





You may think that you have a lot to teach children and will feel humbled when you see that they have a lot to teach you , too . Listen to their perspective about the world and see how it can help you become a more humble , grateful person .

Being around children will help you rejuvenate your sense of wonder . This can help you be more appreciative of the world around you and it will keep you from taking anything for granted .
