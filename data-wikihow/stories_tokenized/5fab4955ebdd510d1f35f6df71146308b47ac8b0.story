Put on some music that has catchy tunes that will relax you . Never use music or songs that have lyrics to them : it will catch your attention too much , unless you are a type that can zone out lyrics , and it will take your mind off of studying . Something in the electronic music genres such as pop or jazz is great for studying . Also if you do not like music you can keep thinking about a favorite scene in a book or movie that you like .
