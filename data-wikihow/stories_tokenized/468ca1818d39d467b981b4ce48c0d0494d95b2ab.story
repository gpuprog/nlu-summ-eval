A moan is a noise of passion that escapes you when you 're overcome by pleasure or sensation -- usually in a sensual context . It 's a way of vocalizing how good you 're feeling . However , not everyone is prone to `` being loud , '' and many people have a hard time making their sensual feelings public . With practice , confidence , and a supportive partner , you may learn to unlock your moan and make it feel more natural. ;
