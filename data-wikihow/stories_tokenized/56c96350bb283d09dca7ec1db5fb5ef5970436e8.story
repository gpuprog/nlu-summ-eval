Once you have filed your response to the plaintiff 's lawsuit you will have to serve a copy on the plaintiff . To do this , have someone 18 or older , who is not related to the case , give the answer to the plaintiff either in person or through the mail . Once the plaintiff has been served , be sure you get a signed proof of service form from the server . This form will have to be filed with the court to prove you actually served the plaintiff .
