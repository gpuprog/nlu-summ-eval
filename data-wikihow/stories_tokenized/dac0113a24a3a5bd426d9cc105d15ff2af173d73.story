Drips can leave darker streaks that are difficult to remove once set . Wipe them up with a damp rag immediately . Drain the brush against the side of the container to prevent more drips .





If you accidentally stain the mortar and ca n't wipe it all off , scrape off the color gently with an old screwdriver or other metal tool .
