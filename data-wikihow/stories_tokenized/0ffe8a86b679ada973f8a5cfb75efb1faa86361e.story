The location of vacation ranches and their terrains vary significantly , so make sure that you take that into account when you select a ranch . You do n't want to pick a ranch with terrain so rocky you can not ride safely , especially if you have children or you are a novice rider . Your choices include mountainous areas versus the plains . The climate you prefer would also make a difference in your overall experience , for example , some people prefer a ranch experience in a desert location , whereas others prefer horseback riding on the beach . Where some ranches offer an assortment of diverse terrain with quiet trails and scenic views , others are limited to less luxurious trails . Additionally , where some ranches are in remote locations , others are close to civilization , highways and noise . You need to take all of these factors into consideration when selecting a vacation ranch that is right for you and your family .
