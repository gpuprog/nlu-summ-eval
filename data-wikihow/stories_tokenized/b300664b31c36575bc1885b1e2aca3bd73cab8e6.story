Play with a pet , go swimming , or jump on a trampoline , make love , play chess ! Doing things you love to do keep you in a good mood , and make you happier . If you had a bad day at school or work , ride a bike and take out your anger . Not only is this fun , but it lets you be yourself for awhile . Try it !
