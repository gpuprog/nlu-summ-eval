Although you may feel that smoking marijuana again can relieve symptoms of withdrawal or may not really hurt you , deviating from your plan may have serious health and legal consequences for you.Continue seeing your doctors , attending support groups , and taking medication . This can help ensure that you stay drug-free . If something is causing you discomfort or stress , speak to your medical health professionals to explore other options that may help you stay clean .
