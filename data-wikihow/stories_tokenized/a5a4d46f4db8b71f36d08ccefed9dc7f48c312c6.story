If you already have car insurance on another car , your plan may automatically cover any new cars purchased for a few days . Check the terms of your policy or call your insurance company to inquire if you have this benefit . This is particularly useful if you are purchasing a used car over the weekend or if you have bought it through a private transaction -LRB- not from a dealer -RRB- . Keep in mind that you will still have to set up an additional policy for the car when those few days are up .
