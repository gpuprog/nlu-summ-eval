Quail need plenty of space to exercise , hide , and eat . Since they can fly , your habitat will also need enough vertical space to accommodate the birds ' vertical flight instinct that can kick in if they are scared or startled.As a general rule of thumb , your enclosure should offer 125 sq. cm -LRB- about 20 sq. in -RRB- per bird .

Your quail habitat needs to be at least 30 cm -LRB- about 1 foot -RRB- high in order to accommodate vertical flight without causing injury to the quail . If you are keeping quail in order to produce eggs , you may need to keep your birds in a relatively small habitat -LRB- like a hutch or pen , rather than a shed or aviary -RRB- . Quail may hide their eggs in the litter on the bottoms of their habitats , so eggs can be difficult to find in a larger enclosure or pen . However , you should still provide at least 125 sq. cm -LRB- about 20 sq. in -RRB- per bird .
