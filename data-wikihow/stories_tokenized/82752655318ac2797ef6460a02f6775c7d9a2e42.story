This does not necessarily have to be a professional , such as an event planner , but it helps , if you can afford it . Otherwise , ask around among friends and relatives to find people who can assist in planning things like seating arrangements and help put up garlands , streamers , tables , and other elements right before the wedding . For more time-consuming or complex tasks , offer to pay a little bit .
