While they appear chock full of free stuff , they are often run by people with little knowledge of the web on the whole . These blogs account for the majority of scam free stuff getting spread around . This is because they feel pressured to post a new free thing everyday . This pressure and their daily journal style pushes them into offering often questionable freebies . The pressure is on when it comes to blog posts . Since they must have a free offer for that day , they feel a lot more pressure to post something that may not be real or is simply outdated . This means more scams and wasted time . It is also not uncommon to see a blog re-post an expired freebie to make you feel like you missed something that day , even though it was not available .
