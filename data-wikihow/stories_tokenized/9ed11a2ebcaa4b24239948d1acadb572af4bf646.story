If you just try to fit your exercise in when you feel like it , you 're less likely to do it . A better plan is to exercise at the same time every day or most days . For instance , you could get up a bit earlier in the morning to do your exercise or try to fit it in right after work . Scheduling it as part of your week makes it easier for you to stick to it .
