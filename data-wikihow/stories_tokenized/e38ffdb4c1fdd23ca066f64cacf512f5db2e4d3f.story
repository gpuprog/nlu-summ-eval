If you 're noticing that your hair is repeatedly frizzy , there 's a chance that your split ends are getting bad . Make sure that you get the right haircut , however . Blunt haircuts tend to bring out frizz . Layers tend to conceal them -LRB- and split-ends -RRB- . Avoid getting too many short layers , especially towards the top of your head . This can cause your hair to poof up .
