Use your child 's favourite toys to create interactive games with strong associations . For instance , set up your child 's favourite stuffed animals and plastic toys on the ground and hold up an alphabet card -LRB- or draw a letter on a whiteboard or piece of paper -RRB- . Have your child pick up the toy that corresponds with that letter -- for instance , they should pick up their toy truck if you hold up the letter `` t '' .
