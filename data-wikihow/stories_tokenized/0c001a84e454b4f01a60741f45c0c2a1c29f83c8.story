Keep fresh flower wreaths fresher longer by using a foam base and soaking it in water . You can buy a foam base from a craft store , like Hobby Lobby , depending on your location . Choose a foam base that is about the size you would like your wreath to be.Keep in mind that the wreath will appear larger once the flowers are on it .
