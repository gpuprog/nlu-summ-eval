Many pathogens are transmitted by infected soil , surrounding fields , birds , and wind . To reduce exposure to pathogens and to keep soil healthy , rotate your strawberry crops every few years .



Strawberries should never follow tomatoes , potatoes , eggplant , peppers , or stone fruits for five years , because these plants can harbor diseases like Verticillium and red stele root rot in the soil .
