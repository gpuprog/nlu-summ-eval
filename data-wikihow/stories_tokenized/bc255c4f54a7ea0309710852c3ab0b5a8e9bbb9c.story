Hot tap water can pick up lead from your water pipes , and is not recommended for drinking or cooking.Start with cold tap water instead . Do n't fill it all the way -- a full pot can splash you as it boils , and you 'll need space to add the food if you 're cooking .



















Do n't believe the myth : cold water does not boil faster than hot water.It 's the safe option , but it will take a bit longer .
