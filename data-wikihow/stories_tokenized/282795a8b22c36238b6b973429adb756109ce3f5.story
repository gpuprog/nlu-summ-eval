Your child ca n't see your eating habits if you 're not eating together . Often , kids who eat meals with their parents and siblings will eat more of the healthier foods , such as vegetables , fruits , and dairy . Try to eat at least one meal a day together , whether it 's breakfast , lunch , or dinner.Don ' t use mealtimes to have serious discussions about behavior or other problems . If you create tension at mealtime , your kids wo n't want to come to eat , making it more difficult to model healthy eating .
