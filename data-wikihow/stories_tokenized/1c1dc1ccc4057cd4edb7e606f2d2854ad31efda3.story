Zinc oxide is the key ingredient in commercial diaper cream and is what coats the skin and kills the bacteria . Zinc oxide makes the skin waterproof and helps to keep it from drying out , which is particularly important in drying and preventing diaper rash.Some organic purists do n't like to include it in their diaper cream because they view it as an added chemical , but you can purchase the pure , non-nano versions at many natural stores and online retailers like Amazon.com .

For an alternative , use a few extra tablespoons of beeswax to thicken the cream .
