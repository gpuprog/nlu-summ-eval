Hygiene plays a key role in maintaining skin integrity . Soap , although important in hygiene , can cause irritation and may not help in removing any of the dead skin caused by dryness . Instead , rinse your feet thoroughly with warm water every time you bathe in order to promote moisture . Warm water -LRB- 40 to 34 Â°C -RRB- promotes circulation and both comforts and refreshes your feet.Always wash the bottoms of your feet well and between your toes . You should use a washcloth to get between your toes or use a long handled sponge on your feet if you prefer not to have to bend down in the shower .
