 If you’ve been building up an online presence and presenting a consistent artistic vision to your fans, someone will probably ask you for a custom work sooner or later. This is really exciting! Don’t get overwhelmed by the process of working with another person’s vision, but ask plenty of questions and offer frequent updates.


Make sure to send your portfolio to someone who inquires about a comission--they should feel like your style is a good match if you’re going to work together.For consistency’s sake, price commissions similarly to other paintings of the same size, materials, and time commitment.
Ask for a deposit of 25% or so before you begin the piece. This will protect you in case the buyer doesn’t like the finished product. In the unlikely event that the buyer refuses the painting, you can keep it and sell it to someone else later.
