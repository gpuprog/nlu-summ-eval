 Essentially you will be making a double slipknot. First, pull the fused ends through the end of the snaphook. Then, loop it through again. Last, finish the slipknot by threading the rest of the paracord through the loop and pulling tightly to secure. For a smaller dog, one slipknot should be sufficient.
