 Before you throw yourself wholeheartedly into the homesteading way of life, take a step back and really assess the situation. What are your long-term goals? Do you simply hope to live more sustainably by growing your own food and finding your place in your community? Or do you hope to become completely self-sufficient, growing your own food and living entirely ‘off the grid’? Whether you want to buy a 26-acre plot of land, or simply make your suburban home more sustainable, you will have to set goals and take time to make a plan. following steps will help you to learn the basics of homesteading, but you will also have to personalize your homestead and make it fit your goals.It is really helpful to talk to someone (or several people) that have already begun their homesteads. They will be able to offer you advice.;
