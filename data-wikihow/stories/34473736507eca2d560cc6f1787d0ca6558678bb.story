 You donâ€™t have to wear a statement coat that is one solid bright color. You can still make just as much of a splash if you go with a coat that is mostly neutral in color, but features bright detailing. For instance, you could wear a deep blue felt biker jacket with a faux fur color in an eye catching color like bright orange. Against the dark blue, the orange really pops.Consider coats that play with color-blocking, as well. This style makes it easy to work a few bright colors into a sophisticated geometric pattern that is mostly neutral.
