 If you’re noticing that your hair is repeatedly frizzy, there’s a chance that your split ends are getting bad. Make sure that you get the right haircut, however. Blunt haircuts tend to bring out frizz. Layers tend to conceal them (and split-ends).Avoid getting too many short layers, especially towards the top of your head. This can cause your hair to poof up.
