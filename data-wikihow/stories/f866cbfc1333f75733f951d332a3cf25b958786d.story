 Pool table felt attracts animal hair from shedding pets. Dirt and dust get into the felt, so keep it covered whenever you aren’t using it to prolong the life of the felt.Pool table covers are often included in the purchase, but if you don’t have one, it is a worthwhile investment to protect your table.
Even if you don’t have a cover and don’t want to buy one, lay a clean sheet, tarp, or blanket over the table which will still keep it cleaner than being uncovered.
