 Using your preliminary research as a guide, turn your broad idea into a research question that you will attempt to answer with your paper. It can be helpful to consider the relationship between your keywords. Did one make or influence the other? Did they happen or live concurrently? The nature of your broad idea will inform the sort of question that makes sense.So, for example, rather than just nature and Prairie Style architecture, a research question could be: How did the Prairie Style architects represent nature in their architecture?
