 This is an important step that is easily overlooked. Be sure that you use a clean, soft, lint-free cloth to remove any moisture from the keyboard after disinfecting it. Also, make sure that you do not hold the wipe on the keyboard for too long. After you wipe each key, discard the wipe and dry the keyboard gently.
