 Though there are many differences between indoor and outdoor soccer, the overall objective and methods of playing are more similar than they are different. Therefore, knowing the similarities will help you pick up the mechanics of indoor soccer more quickly.


For example, standard rules of no contact apply in indoor soccer. You cannot hit, intentionally kick, or otherwise physically obstruct another player during the game.
The method of scoring a goal is also the same. To score a goal, a player must kick the ball into the opposing teamâ€™s goal box, passing over the goal line, between the posts, and under the crossbar.If the referee calls a foul for breaking a rule (such as using your hands), the same rule of a free kick on the part of the opposite team applies.
