 The important neurological issues to watch out for include numbness, cognitive problems, and shooting pains. These may indicate inflammation of the brain or spinal cord, and need to be addressed immediately.Shooting pains in any part of your body that occur at night are a readily recognizable sign of neurological issues.
Numbness or tingling sensations in your extremities may also indicate potential neurological issues caused by Lyme disease.
Any cognitive issues you notice, even simply changes in your short-term memory, may also indicate neurological complications.
