 Remember that sinks should be much thicker then most of the pots you have ever made. You probably will need about 6-9 kg (13.2-19.8 lb) of clay for a 30 cm (12 in) external diameter sink or 12-15kg (26.4-33 lb) for 42 cm (16 7/8 in) diameter sink. The quantity of clay depends on the sink type. Vessel sinks need to be thicker than drop-down sinks.

Weigh the needed amount of clay.
