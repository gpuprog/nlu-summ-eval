 Burmillas have a genetic predisposition to develop polycystic kidney disease. This can lead to the kidneys not functioning properly. Common symptoms of kidney disease are vomiting, frequent urination, and appetite loss. Take your cat to the vet often to have their kidneys and overall health checked.If possible, get your cat from a breeder who has the parents' kidneys tested before breeding.
