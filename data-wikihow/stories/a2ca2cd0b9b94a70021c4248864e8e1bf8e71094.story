 The carnitas are good as is, just in their own juices. However, if you want a little more flavor on the side, try a Sriracha-flavored mayo or a Sriracha sour cream.


For the mayo, mix Sriracha, mayonnaise, and soy sauce, to taste.For the sour cream, mix about ¼ cup of sour cream with ½ to 1 Tbsp of Sriracha.

Whip up a sauce, if desired.
