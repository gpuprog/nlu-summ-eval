 After you’ve constructed the puppy area, place a heat mat underneath the paper in this area. After the puppies are born, you’ll turn this heat mat on to a low setting. This helps the puppies to keep warm while they are away from the mother.An alternative to a heat mat is a heat lamp, angled towards one corner of the box to provide a warm spot. However, a heat lamp provides dry heat, which can dry out the puppy’s skin. If you have to use a lamp, be sure to check the puppies regularly for flaky or red skin. Remove the lamp if this happens.Use a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel to provide temporary warmth.
