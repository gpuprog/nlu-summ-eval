 Before anything is signed, have your forms reviewed by a courthouse facilitator. Most courts in Oregon have a courthouse facilitator program, which helps people with family law cases. Most facilitators offer document review services, either for walk-ins or by appointment.You can find detailed information for facilitator services in each county at http://courts.oregon.gov/OJD/docs/OSCA/cpsd/courtimprovement/familylaw/FacilitatorsList.pdf. Facilitators do not represent you or give legal advice, but they can review your forms and help you with any questions you have about the process.
