 If the situation is dire and you can’t stop thinking about him, try picking up a new hobby. This way you can avoid putting yourself in a situation where you’ll see him, and you can give yourself a distraction to keep from thinking about him.Do something that will take your total concentration, like doing a puzzle. You can also find something to do outdoors, like identifying plants or insects.
