 Itâ€™s important for children to learn to cover their mouths when they sneeze and use tissues for coughs or sniffles, so as to not spread germs to their classmates and friends. Practice hygiene at home by reminding your child to cover their mouth when they cough or sneeze. Whenever your child wipes their nose, make sure their tissue goes into the trash can right away.Go over good bathroom hygiene, too. Remind them to wipe thoroughly, always flush the toilet, and wash their hands each time they use the restroom.
