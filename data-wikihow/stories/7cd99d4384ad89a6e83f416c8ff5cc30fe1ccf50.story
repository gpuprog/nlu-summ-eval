 Call your local hospital, police station, fire station, or other location that you believe may be a Safe Haven site. Ask the person who answers if they do accept drop-offs, if they have certain times, and if they have certain requirements. If you are concerned for your anonymity on the phone, you can dial #67 before calling to block your number from appearing.
