 If your teen is just beginning to experience signs of heatstroke, it's important to encourage them to drink hydrating fluids. Stop whatever your teen is doing immediately, and go to a cool place. Next, encourage a lot of hydration. This can help their body function enough to cool itself down.Go for hydrating beverages like cold water, sparkling water or an electrolyte drink.
Do not give them sugary drinks like juice or soda and definitely do not allow them to have alcohol.
Only encourage your teen to drink if they're conscious and able to drink by themselves.
