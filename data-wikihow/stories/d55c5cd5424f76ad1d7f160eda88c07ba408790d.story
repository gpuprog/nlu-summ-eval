 The first two layers should be ?‚Äù untreated plywood but the top layer can be Skatelite, Masonite, or you can simply skate directly on Plywood. Choose the top layer based on your budget and climate.Skatelite is the most costly surface as it is used by professionals and is weather resistant.
Masonite is a smooth tempered hardboard that is reasonably priced but is not resistant to the sun and rain so it must be protected.
Plywood is not weather resistant and is unforgiving when you fall but is the most cost effective choice for your surface.
