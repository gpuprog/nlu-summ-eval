 The amount of energy and fuel it takes to transport organic matter to a waste facility (if your community doesn’t have composting) will contribute to your carbon footprint. On top of that, organic matter doesn’t properly break down in that sort of environment, so you are much better off composting yourself. Not only will you reduce the amount of waste you send to landfills, but you’ll also have homemade soil to plant and fertilize your garden.
