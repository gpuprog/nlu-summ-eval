 You may experience times when you need to ask for help. You have limited energy and may not be able to get everything done each day. If this is the case, you may want to ask your loved ones for help with small things.For example, if a friend or family member is going to the grocery store, you may want to ask them to pick you up a few things. If you live with others, you might ask them to do a load of laundry or load the dishwasher on days when you have limited energy.
