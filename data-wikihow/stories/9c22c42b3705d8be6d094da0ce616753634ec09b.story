 If you have a pet frog, or if you've decided to care for a frog over the winter, you'll need to create a comfortable habitat for the frog. For indoor care, a glass aquarium is the best environment you can provide. Make sure your frog has some type of shelter within the aquarium in case it wants to hide, as well as a suitable substrate for digging/burrowing.Consider putting down a bed of gravel in part or all of the aquarium, depending on the type of frog you're caring for. Tree frogs will probably prefer a sterile mix of sand and potting soil.Provide plants in aquatic environments. Frogs that hibernate underwater need to be able to take in adequate oxygen through their skin underwater, which means they'll need lots of photosynthetic plants in the water with them.Some frogs will attempt to eat other frogs. For this reason, it's best to keep frogs of the same size together in the same tank, if you plan on caring for multiple frogs.
