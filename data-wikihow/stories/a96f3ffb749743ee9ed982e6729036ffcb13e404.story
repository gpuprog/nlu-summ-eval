 On top of your living conditions, consider common needs for different breeds of dogs. Certain breeds, such as Pomeranians, may need more regular grooming. Many breeds are also prone to different types of medical problems. Small dogs, for example, often have hip problems while larger dogs are often prone to early arthritis.Consider both the monetary cost and level of commitment involved in caring for a breedâ€™s specific needs. Will you have time to brush their coat out once a week? Will you have the resources to keep them on daily medication when they get older?
Ask a breeder or a vet about breed-specific needs. They can give you an idea of what is typically necessary to keep that breed happy and healthy throughout their life.
