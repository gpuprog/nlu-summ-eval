 Donâ€™t just cup the soap in your hand and pass it back and forth between your palms. To really clean the skin on your hands, it is important to lather the soap onto both sides of the hands, in-between the fingers, under and around the nails, and up onto your wrists. You should do this for at least 20 seconds.
