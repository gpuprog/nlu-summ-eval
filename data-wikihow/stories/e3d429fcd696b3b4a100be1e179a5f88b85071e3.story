 constant communication is required, there is no point in 5 bands bringing 5 drum kits, and 5 sets of amps, only for four of them sit outside in vans ready to be stolen. generally it is the headlining acts job to supply a drum kit, and the other drummers will have to provide what are known as breakables, (snare, cymbals, bass drum pedal) However, some drummers are not comfortable with this and will want other bands to use another kit. If each band does use their own kit, the gap between bands will go from 15 minutes to 25 and sound checks will be at least 5 minutes longer. On a night with three bands, not a problem, 5 bands and an 11 O'clock cut off, you will have major night mares. Likewise with guitarists, it is generally acceptable to use other people cabs (the speakers under their amps) but not the amps themselves unless the bands know each other and/or are particularly laid back. This gets tricky when headlining acts have combo amps or not enough cabs to go around. Then you have the added complication of a bands that isn't just drums/bass/gtr/vocals. Keyboards, Acoustic Guitars, mandolins, banjo's, kazoos, brass sections, harps etc can bring on premature aging in a sound engineer if they are presented on the night with no prior warning. Start with the headlining act, What will they bring, what will they need, what will they share. Tell the next band down what is available to them, then ask them the same three questions. By the time you get to the bottom couple of bands, you should have all your shortages sorted. There may be drum kits coming from one band, cabs from others that only certain bands can use etc, but as long as you have it all written down, it should be fairly easy to keep track of. From this, you should be able to, with the help of your sound engineer, work out how long they need for sound checking, if they all need a sound check and then organise times and let the bands know. Sounds like a lot of work, and it is, but it will save you from some big time stress on the night.

Organising gear requirements, gear sharing and sound check times is tricky.
