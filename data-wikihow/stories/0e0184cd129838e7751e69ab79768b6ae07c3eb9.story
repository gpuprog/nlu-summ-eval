If you go for tactical (ranged, in other games) then choose water-type. (They are very good at not making melee contact with enemies, giving them an advantage over Pok√©mon that rely on abilities like rough skin).
If you prefer taking advantage of the enemies' weaknesses, then use the grass-type. (They have moves such as leech seed that drain equal amounts of health regardless of type and level.)
