 Fill a glass jar with 2 cups (480 grams) of Epsom salts and ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of minty mouthwash. Stir until the salt is evenly-soaked; you will get something that feels like wet sand. To use the scrub: massage 1 to 2 tablespoons of the scrub onto your feet, then rinse it off. Store the rest of the scrub in a cool, dry place.This scrub will help exfoliate and deodorize your feet. It will leave them feeling refreshed, making it ideal after a long day of walking.
