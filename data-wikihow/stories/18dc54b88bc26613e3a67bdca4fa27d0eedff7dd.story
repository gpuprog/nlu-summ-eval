 If youâ€™re lucky enough to have one, a librarian villager (the ones with white robes) will sometimes be partial to trade you a Name Tag for about 20-22 emeralds (the currency of villagers, acquired by trading) apiece as a late-tier trade. You can unlock these trades by trading with them enough times.
