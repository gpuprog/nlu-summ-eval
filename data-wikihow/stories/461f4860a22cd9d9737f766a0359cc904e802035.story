 You will be moving through different postures while you are practicing, so you will need to be in a space that is relatively large. You should be able to stretch your arms and not touch any objects. You want to be able to move around freely in the space without bumping into anything or tripping over something.If you are outdoors, make sure there are no rocks, roots, or raised areas that you may trip over.
