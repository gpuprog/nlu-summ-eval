 Make it clear that you're willing to work through things and that you are not judging your friend. If your friend is panicking, having a meltdown or going all dramatic on you, intervene quickly and suggest some quiet time. Suggest that your friend relax, taking deep breaths and sitting still for a bit, with you. You can clear the air better when your friend has calmed down.
