 There are several different surgical options to treat bunions and the type of surgery you get will depend on how severe your bunions are. Your surgeon may remove the bunions and use pins, wires, or screws to hold the bones in your feet in place to allow them to heal.The most common type of bunion surgery is osteotomy. This procedure involves cutting and removing part of the bone in your toe. The surgeon will also realign the bone inside your big toe and move your toe joint back in line.
Your surgeon may recommend arthrodesis if your big toe is severely deformed due to the bunion and it is too difficult to fix the joint. This procedure involves fusing together two bones in your big toe joint. After this procedure, you will have limited movement of your big toe and you cannot wear high heels.
Most bunion surgeries take about one hour and are done under general anesthesia. Your surgeon should outline the procedure fully for you before you go under.
