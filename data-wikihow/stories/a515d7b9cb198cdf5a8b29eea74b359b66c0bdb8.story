 Telling your partner about your PTSD may be only the first step in recovery and relationship building. You may decide that couples or family therapy may be helpful to help strengthen your relationship with your partner and help both of you learn how to communicate and deal with your situation.Ask your partner to go to therapy with you. For example, you may tell your partner, “I value you and our relationship. As part of my therapy/treatment, I think that the two of us should go to therapy together. I want to work on our relationship because I love you.”
