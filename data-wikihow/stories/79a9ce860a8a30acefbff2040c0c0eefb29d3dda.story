 As you create your budget, call around to identify the price of parts and labor. Purchasing pavers and labor together will make the process faster, but is not a necessary step in the process. To keep costs down, you can purchase pavers on your own, and pay for labor separately.Donâ€™t be afraid to haggle! Prices are rarely set in stone.
Concrete pavers are usually cheapest, while brick and stone cost more.
To get the most for your buck, try to find discontinued pavers. These are usually marked down to a significant degree and are wonderful for a small budget.;
