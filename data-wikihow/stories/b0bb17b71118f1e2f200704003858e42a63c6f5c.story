 Summer Hottie makeup should be light and fun. This is not the time to apply a full mask of makeup every morning. With rising temperatures and plenty of water activities, two key words in your makeup rotation in the summer should be sweat-proof and waterproof. Start off with a light tinted moisturizer in your skin tone. Look for one with SPF to protect your skin from UVA and UVB rays that can damage your skin. Apply a light brushing of bronzer to your cheeks. For eyes, apply a light wash of color over the eyelid in a summery shade that works with your skin tone. Finish off with two coats of waterproof mascara. For lips, a clear gloss is really all that you need. For nighttime, give yourself a little something extra with some waterproof eyeliner or a darker lip color. Though, to be super-safe, because mascara does smudge, even if it's waterproof, wear whatever eyeshadow you want, but then apply two coats of clear mascara. That gives them a boost and shine. They look naturally healthy. Then apply a lip balm with sun protection. Then over it apply a little lip gloss, not too much though or it looks tacky.;
