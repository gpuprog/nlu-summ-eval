 If the blood is pulsing or squirting from the wound or if the dressing where you are applying pressure becomes soaked with blood, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. With these symptoms, you may need stitches or staples to close the wound and stop the bleeding. You may also have a small bleeding arteriole that needs to be tied off individually with sutures to stop the bleeding.


If you know the person is taking blood thinners, take them to an emergency room right away, especially if the wound is on their head.
If the wound is greater than 1 centimeter (0.39Â in) deep, it will require sutures or stitches.
