 Keep in mind that purchasing a multitude of pet training supplies all at once could add up to a substantial bill. Consider coming up with homemade versions of some items. Or, watch for sales as they pop up. You can also buy some of the more generic items in bulk, such as puppy training pads.An example of a homemade item would be if you personally cooked your dogâ€™s treats for its agility training.
As you think about the cost it may also be worthwhile to purchase an extended warranty, if it is available. This very much depends on the item, including the odds that it could get damaged during regular use.
