 When the plane yaws, it turns to one side. Straighten out the flight path by adjusting the wings. Grasp the wing opposite the direction you want the plane to go. Tilt the end of this wing up and towards the center of the plane. Turn the end of the opposite wing downwards and away from center.For example, if your plane goes left, tilt the left wing upwards and to the right. Tilt the right wing downwards and to the right.

Correct yawing by pulling the backs of the wings to the side.
