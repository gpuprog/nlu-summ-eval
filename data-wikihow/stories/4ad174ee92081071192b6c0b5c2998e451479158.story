 Most starters have two retaining bolts that hold the starter in place against the side of the motor where it meets the transmission. Use a socket of the appropriate size to remove the bolts in order remove the starter.Be sure to use the correct size socket, otherwise you risk damaging the bolts.
You may need to pull on the starter with a bit of force in order to remove it from the engine once the bolts have been removed.
