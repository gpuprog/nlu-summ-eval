 The gift can be quite simple or an elaborate planned event.


Fill a jar with chocolates or other candies and attach a card that reads, "Sweet 16." Bake 16 muffins or cookies to give to the anniversary couple or significant other.
Create a scavenger hunt in which the couple visits 16 places that are significant in their relationship. Send the couple on a 16-night trip, or make reservations for the couple for a weekend in Tennessee, the 16th state in the United States.
