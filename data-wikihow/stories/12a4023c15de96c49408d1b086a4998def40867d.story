 You may be able to pull a small vehicle out of whatever it is stuck in with only one or two friends, but larger vehicles will require more friends to assist. Gather a group of as many friends as you can before you start to ensure you are able to pull the vehicle.The more friends you gather, the easier it will be.
Ensure you have plenty of extra rope so thereâ€™s enough room for everyone to assist.
