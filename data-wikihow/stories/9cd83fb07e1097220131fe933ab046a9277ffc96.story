 The depth of the holes will vary depending on the type of seed you are planting. It is recommended that you start by planting green beans. They are hardy seeds that should grow easily. Read the directions on your seed packet to know how deep to make the holes. Use your finger or a pencil to make the holes in the soil.If you are planting beans, the holes should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep.
Make the holes near the edge of the bottle. This way you will be able to easily see the roots growing.
