 A treatment originally developed for people suffering from serious eye problems, you can have a small silicon disc implanted over your iris to change the color of your eye. Almost like a permanent set of contact lenses, the colored disc will turn your eyes bright blue. However, there are serious downsides to the procedure: more than one person has gone blind as a result of seeking out the procedure for cosmetic reasons. Iris implants are typically only used on patients who are going blind or who have serious cataracts, and should be avoided for the sole purpose of changing your eye color.Iris implants arenâ€™t available cosmetically inside the United States.
