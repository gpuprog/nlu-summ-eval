 By delivering piglets that are free of parasites and keeping them quarantined from infected pigs, you can help ensure a healthy generation of pigs on your farm. Some experts suggest that caesarean-derived piglets are more likely to be free of mites than piglets delivered through a natural birth.Talk to a veterinarian about caesarean births for your pigs.
Make sure newborn piglets are not exposed to infected livestock, as experts generally advise against using insecticides on piglets.
