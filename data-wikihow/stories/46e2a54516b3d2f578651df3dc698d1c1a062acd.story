 Never cheat on a test. Cheating can get you a big old goose egg, "0". You don't want that to happen do you? Cheating can lead to suspension and even expulsion, so if you ever feel the need to glance over and compare answers control yourself, you never know what the consequence can be..but the worst part is that when you cheat, you don't learn. If you go to school and you don't learn, the whole thing seems like a waste of time. Cheating cheats YOU out of an education.
