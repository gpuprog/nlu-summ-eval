 Claims are the critical part of a non-provisional patent application. (They are not necessary to the provisional application.)A claim defines the limits of what a patent covers.Another way to think of a claim is that it will exclude others from making, using and selling only what is claimed.Thus, if a substance is claimed as a binding agent, the inventor cannot exclude those who would use the substance as a flavoring substance.


A product may have several claims, each of which will be evaluated by the patent examiner.
Claims are written as sentence fragments.Here is the claim for concrete: “A rigid building and paving material comprising a mixture of: (a) sand and stones, and (b) a hardened cement binder filling the interstices between and adhering to sand and stones, whereby a hardened, rigid, and strong matrix for building and paving will be provided.”To write a claim, think about all the various components of your product and how they relate and interconnect. You can begin with this template: “A comprising: and .”
