 Word of mouth is a powerful tool in the music business. If you know other singers or songwriters who have already licensed their music, find out who they have worked with. Ask if they have been satisfied with their deals and with the money they have received. The way a company treats one artist is a sign of how theyâ€™re going to treat you.
