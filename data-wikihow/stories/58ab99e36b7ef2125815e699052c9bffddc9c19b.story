 The number one thing to remember when interacting with someone affected by any form of interpersonal violence is to never blame them. Victim blaming perpetuate the isolation that they are already feeling and will not help the situation in any way, shape or form. Listen to the person, provide them options and then remain a support system for them as they choose whatever path they believe is best. Whether they want to stay in or leave the relationship there are ways to be supportive. Remember that their safety, not just physically but mentally and emotionally as well, are most important.

Don't blame the victim/survivor.
