 If there are any holes in the door, such as nail marks, fill these in with small amounts of bondo or wood filler. Go over the door and locate holes and cracks. When you find one, inject some filler into the hole to fill it. Smooth down the filler and press it into the hole or crack with a putty knife or scraper.When you’ve filled all the holes, set the door aside to let the filler dry. Read the manufacturer’s directions for exact times.
