 Millionaires are used to having the best of the best in their lives, so they want a partner who brings a lot to the table. Physical appearance definitely matters, but having a good personality and intellect is also important. That means you should make sure that you look neat and attractive, but also be able to engage in interesting conversation.To make a good impression, dress to impress on your date. Forget jeans and a t-shirt, and go for a more polished look, such as your best cocktail dress or suit and tie. Make sure that your clothing fits well too.
Just as with any potential partner, a millionaire may be looking for specific traits in a significant other, such as a love of the outdoors or an Ivy League degree. As you get to know him or her better, you'll be able to tell if you're really a good fit for each other.
