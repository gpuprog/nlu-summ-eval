 To prove that you are a know-it-all, you should strive to do well on all your exams and tests in school. Being a model student will show your peers and your teachers that you do in fact know it all and are able to perform well academically. You should study hard for your exams well in advance so you are prepared and confident going into the exam.You may also try studying with your peers for exams, though you may find this difficult as a know-it-all. Collaborating and working with your peers can make you a stronger student, even if you may have to sacrifice some of your know-it-all traits.
