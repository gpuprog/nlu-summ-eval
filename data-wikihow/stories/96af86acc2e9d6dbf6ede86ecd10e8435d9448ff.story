 If you're planning to go to a good college and you're always reading books in school because of that, never let any of your friends demoralize you. If they call you a "nerd", that is fine; but you can choose to ignore them instead of absorbing their teases or stopping your studies. They are the ones who will regret when the exam results are out and they didn't score well.
