 Don’t carry your card by itself in your pocket, where it might easily fall out or be stolen. Don’t leave your card exposed longer than necessary, as thieves might take a picture of it. If you carry your card in a purse, make sure your purse is zipped tight unless you’re removing something or placing something in it.
