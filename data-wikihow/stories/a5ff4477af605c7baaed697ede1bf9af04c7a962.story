 While a mandoline is often safer to use than a knife, it is still extremely sharp and can be dangerous if you don’t use it properly. Make sure to set the tool on a flat, even surface, so it doesn’t move around as you’re julienning the carrots.The best surface to put the mandoline on is a cutting board that is secure on your countertop so it won’t move around either.
