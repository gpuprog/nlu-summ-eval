 Instead of using the standard milk chocolate, use a gourmet chocolate that contains more cocoa solids. Look for a bittersweet or semisweet chocolate bar. For something even more sophisticated, try:White chocolate with mint
Salted caramel filled chocolate bars
Cocoa nib chocolate bars (for a little crunch)
Cappuccino or coffee flavored chocolate
