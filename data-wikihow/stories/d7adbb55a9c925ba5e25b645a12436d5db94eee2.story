 You may first discover that your identity has been stolen when the IRS sends you a notice that you owe money or that more than one tax return was filed in your name. Do not delay; call the number listed on the IRS notice, and fill out an Identity Theft Affidavit Form 14039, available at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf.
