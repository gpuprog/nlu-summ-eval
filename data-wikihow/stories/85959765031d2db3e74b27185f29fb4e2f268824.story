 One of the biggest indicators of depression is a change in how much and how well you sleep. People with depression tend to either sleep too much or struggle with insomnia. If you sleep at irregular hours, have a hard time getting out of bed, or need a nap to get through the day, depression could be to blame.Keep in mind that psoriasis can cause sleep problems even in people who are not depressed.
