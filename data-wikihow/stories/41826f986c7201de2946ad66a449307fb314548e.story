 The heat will create a convection current in the UF6 that will draw the lighter 235U isotope toward the hotter inner pipe and push the heavier 238U isotope toward the colder outer pipe.


This process was investigated in 1940 as part of the Manhattan Project, but was abandoned while still in an early stage of development when the more efficient gaseous diffusion process was developed.
