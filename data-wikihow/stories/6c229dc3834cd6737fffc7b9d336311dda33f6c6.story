 When we want someone to like us, it can be tempting to put on a persona you think your crush wants in a significant other. While pretending to share interests and viewpoints may win your crush over in the short-term, you won't be able to build a real relationship from white lies. It's better to be honest and stay yourself. Instead of pretending to know everything about his or her favorite hobby, share something about your own.

Keep yourself from pretending to be someone you're not.
