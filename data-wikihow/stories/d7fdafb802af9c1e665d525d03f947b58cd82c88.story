 Exercising is a great way to get outdoors, but you don't have to be active to sit outside and enjoy the fresh air. Sometimes simply being outside the house - especially if you live near nature - can calm your anxious mind and reduce your stress levels.Try sitting outside. You can watch the sunset, or simply set aside a half hour before or after dinner to enjoy a cup of decaffeinated tea outdoors.
If you have a porch or patio you can sit there. If not, you can simply sit in the grass, or set up a lawn chair in your yard.
