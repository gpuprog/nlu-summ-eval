 Heat stylers like curling irons or straightening irons can cause damage to any hair type, but they are particularly harsh on fine hair. Itâ€™s best for your hair not to use irons at all, but if they are an important part of your beauty routine, use a heat protective spray before using heat tools. Heat protective sprays coat the strands of your hair so that they are not damaged by the heat of the iron.
