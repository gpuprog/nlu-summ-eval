 Getting surgery done will help put your bones back into their proper places, and keep them in those proper places. On the positive side of things, getting surgery will speed up your recovery timeâ€”while you have to wait out a cast, you will be on the mend within days after your surgery.There are two parts to ankle surgery.

Then, through external fixation, metal plates are drilled into the bone and screws are placed to ensure very minute movement of the affected bones.
