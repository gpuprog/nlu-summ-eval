 Both intoxication and withdrawal can cause noticeable “unsteadiness” in a person. If an individual is shaking, trembling, or sweating, they may be experiencing drug or alcohol withdrawal. If they are unable to walk straight or appear clumsy, an individual may be intoxicated by alcohol, opiates, or other depressant drugs.
