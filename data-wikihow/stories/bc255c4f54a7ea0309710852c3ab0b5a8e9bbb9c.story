 Hot tap water can pick up lead from your water pipes, and is not recommended for drinking or cooking.Start with cold tap water instead. Don't fill it all the way â€” a full pot can splash you as it boils, and you'll need space to add the food if you're cooking.









Don't believe the myth: cold water does not boil faster than hot water.It's the safe option, but it will take a bit longer.
