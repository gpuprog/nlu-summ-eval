 Now that you’ve made an initial list, you’ll need to decide how to tackle your workload in an organized way. Mark down the first item on your agenda as “1” and continue onward. You will want to take into account the due date, the difficulty level of the task, the grade’s weight in your final average, and your individual confidence level in each area.To assess difficulty, you may want to look at your other scores for similar material. For example, if you received a 65 on the last quiz, you may need to spend some more time in that area. This may take priority over studying for a class where you are holding a consistent “A” average.
Also, if you know that your notes are weaker in a certain class, you may want to move it up on your list as it may take more time to catch-up and make any note fixes.
Be careful of listing all of one course’s assignments together in the priority order as you may get burnt out just working on one subject over and over again. Instead, look for opportunities to integrate different projects into your list while still making progress.
