 People with dementia can have difficulty seeing distinct edges on objects. For instance, they may not be able to see where the staircase ends or where a step up into the kitchen is. Even if they've lived in the house for years, dementia can make them forget where these hazards are. Adding visual cues, such as bright duct tape on a stair, can help reduce the risk.
