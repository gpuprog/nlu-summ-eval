 Whether you decide on a bank or credit union, your first step should be making sure that an institution is properly insured and approved by the federal government. Most large institutions are a safe bet, but smaller ones might not be up to the strictest standards. It's always a good idea to check and make sure any place you put your money if properly insured.For banks, visit the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation site.
For credit unions, visit the National Credit Union Administration site.
