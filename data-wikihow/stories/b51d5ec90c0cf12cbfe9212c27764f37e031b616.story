 Use your pencil and yardstick or ruler to measure out regular intervals where you will support and connect your trusses with cross bracing popsicle sticks. For the purposes of this model, you will be using two sticks side by side in a W pattern.Another way to think of this: each line of the W pattern that will connect two trusses together represents two popsicle sticks laid side by side.
The more bracing you have, the stronger your bridge will be. However, too many popsicle sticks might make it difficult to see anything move across the deck of your bridge.
