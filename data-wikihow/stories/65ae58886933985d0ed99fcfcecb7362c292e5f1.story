 As a document that affects real property rights, your lease agreement should be recorded along with your deed.


To record the lease, you must go to the county recorder's office in the county where your property is located. In addition to filing fees, you should expect to pay real property taxes on the transfer.The recordation process and requirements vary from state to state, but generally the lease must be in writing, signed, and contain a full legal description of the property. Typically you can use the description of your property contained in your original deed to guide this description.
