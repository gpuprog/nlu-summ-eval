 Not all sands are the same. If you are using standard play sand then you can rake and siphon it without too many worries regarding tank pollution. If, however, you have a specialty planting sand youâ€™ll need to be very careful when raking as it can release ammonia when disturbed. Read the instructions and warnings carefully on the package to find out if any special handling is necessary.You can also visit your local aquarium store and talk with an expert who will advise you regarding your sand options. Some options, such as coral sand, are quite beautiful but can be dangerous to particular species of fish.;
