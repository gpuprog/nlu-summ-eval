 As a new group fitness instructor, possibly with your own business, you may need to spend some extra time getting yourself known in your community and with potential clients. One of the best ways to bring in new clients is through word of mouth, so encourage your existing clients, friends, family, etc., to spread the word that you’re an awesome instructor.Great marketing tools include: personalized websites (that are well maintained), social media pages (that are frequently updated), flyers and posters, business cards, and newsletters.
You may also want to consider offering free classes for new clients in order to encourage them to give you a try. If they have a great time, they’re likely to come back AND talk about you to their friends.
