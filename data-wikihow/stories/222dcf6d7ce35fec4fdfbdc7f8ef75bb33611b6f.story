 Let go of any bad, embarrassing moments, mistakes, or worries. Let go of things you've done or situations you've been in. Let go of it all. That was the old you. Think of it as you were possessed. You were possessed by stress. Don't think about it, be embarrassed by it, or regret it. You've obviously learned from it, and you're changing. Let go of it all. You are no longer the you you originally knew. You are new in the eyes of everyone.
