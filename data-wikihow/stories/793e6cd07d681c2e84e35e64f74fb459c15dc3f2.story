 If you trying to go to sleep early, avoid coffee and other caffeinated products, nicotine, and other stimulants. Their effects can last for hours, making it hard to go to sleep when you want to.And while depressants like alcohol can initially make you feel sleepy, they can actually disturb your sleep.Sleeping pills are often used as a means of inducing sleep. However, these can often be habit-forming, can impair memory and motor skills, and actually disrupt sleeping patterns.There are many different types of sleeping pills and their effects vary, so you should carefully follow the instructions of all over-the-counter and prescribed pills, and talk to your doctor if you have questions or concerns.
