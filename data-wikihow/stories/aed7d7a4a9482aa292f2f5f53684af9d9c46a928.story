 If you are foraging anywhere other than your own property, make sure you aren’t breaking any rules by doing so. Don’t harvest on private property. With public land, double-check with your local, state, or federal government to find out if there are any rules prohibiting you from removing vegetation or otherwise disturbing the environment.
