 As you are preparing for your day, check the weather. Simply check your weather app, flick on the television or radio, check the newspaper, or use the internet (www.weather.com) to figure out what kind of weather you may encounter. If you live in or commute to a large city with many high rise buildings, check the wind conditions!


If you do not have access to the internet, a radio, a TV or a newspaper, do yourself a favor and ask a friend. There is nothing worse than being caught off guard by windy conditions that you did not expect.;
