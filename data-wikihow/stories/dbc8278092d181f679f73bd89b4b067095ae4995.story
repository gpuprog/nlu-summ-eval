 Before you ask her out, you have to realize that girls like guys that have confidence, but they understand shyness. So, be yourself. If you act like something you're not, she's going to find out sooner or later, so just be yourself. If she doesn't like you for who you are, then so be it. She may just not be right for you, and there's plenty of other women out there. And be aware that some shy girls may be kind of scared by someone too confident, so find a balance.
