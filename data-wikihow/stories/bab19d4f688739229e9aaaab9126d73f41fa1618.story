 Even if it can't be honored (such as cases in which health/safety is at stake), a child needs to know that their protests are heard and respected. This helps them understand that adults will always listen to them, even in tough times.Does the child know that they are allowed to say no and "I can't"? If not, teach them how to do it.Is the child allowed to opt out of optional activities? For example, if they want to play alone, do adults force, cajole, or bribe them into playing with other children?
If they need to do something they don't like, are any explanations given? Does the adult try to make adjustments to make it better, and do they explain why it has to happen?
If something is uncomfortable or painful, do adults let them not do it? Or, if they have to do it, do adults do everything they can to make it more comfortable?

Pay close attention to what happens if a child says no.
