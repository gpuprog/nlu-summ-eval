 The most common type of vertigo, BPPV, happens when tiny calcium carbonate crystals in one part of your inner ear float to another part of your inner ear, disrupting your equilibrium and triggering the uncomfortable dizzy sensation of vertigo. The crystals can get dislodged during the night when you move your head in certain ways, and sleeping with your head slightly elevated will prevent this from happening as often.Sleep on your back instead of your side or stomach, and prop your head up with an extra pillow while you're sleeping.
