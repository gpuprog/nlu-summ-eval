 Wash 1 1/2 pounds (680 g) of small, Yukon gold potatoes and gently scrub the skins. Cut the potatoes into bite-sized cubes and place them in a large pot or Dutch oven. Pour enough water into the pot to cover the potatoes by about 1-inch (2.5 cm).If you prefer, you can cut the potatoes into thin slices instead of cubes.
