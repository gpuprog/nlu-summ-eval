 The most common food allergies are milk, eggs, peanuts and other nuts, soybeans, wheat, fish, and shellfish. Most kids outgrow their food allergies, but it is important to identify them to avoid serious reactions. If your child experiences any of the following after eating, they may be having an allergic reaction: hives; swelling; itching lips, tongue, or mouth; abdominal pain; nausea; vomiting; diarrhea; wheezing; shortness of breath; or lightheadedness.Some children may have a serious, possibly life-threatening allergic reaction to foods known as anaphylaxis. If they experience swelling of the airway, serious difficulty with breathing, a drop in blood pressure, or two or more of the above symptoms simultaneously, call emergency services immediately.
