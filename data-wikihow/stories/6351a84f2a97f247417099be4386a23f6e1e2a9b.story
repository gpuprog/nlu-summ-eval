 Since scoliosis is usually pretty mild, it's not easy to detect. Parents don't always notice it in their children, since it develops slowly and causes almost imperceptible changes in appearance. Scoliosis testing is mandatory in some school systems, and teachers or school nurses are often the people who first notice the presence of the condition. These signs that scoliosis might be present are:Uneven shoulders.
One prominent shoulder blade.
Uneven waist or hips.
