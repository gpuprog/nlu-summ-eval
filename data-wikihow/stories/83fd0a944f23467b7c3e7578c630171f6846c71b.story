 Micro-aggressions are often seemingly minor comments that may not be overtly racist but still upset the receiver. Sometimes, people don’t even know they are being discriminatory with these comments/behaviors. One potentially effective way to stand up for yourself is to not allow the issue to pass by without incident.If someone said something ugly to you or acted in an unfair way towards you, it may help—them overcome their own ignorance and you feel better—if you call them on it. Say something like “Excuse me, but what did you mean by that?” Request that the person explain their actions. If they claim to not know what you’re talking about, state the facts and wait for their response.
If you do not feel brave enough or think the person deserves your reaction, speak out in some other way. Write a detailed social media post giving testimony to the racism you encountered. Get the message out there to shed insight to those who are ignorant of racism’s existence and impact.
