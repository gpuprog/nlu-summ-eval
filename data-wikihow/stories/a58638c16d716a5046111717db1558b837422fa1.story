 This method is an accelerated depreciation method. Instead of spreading the cost of the asset evenly over the course of its useful life, a higher rate of depreciation is recorded in the beginning, and the rate of depreciation declines over time. This method would be used for equipment that is used more in the early years of its life.The idea is that the equipment generates more revenue in the early years of its life than in later years as it becomes less productive. Therefore it is more accurate to record more of the expense through depreciation earlier and less later on as the equipmentâ€™s productivity declines.
