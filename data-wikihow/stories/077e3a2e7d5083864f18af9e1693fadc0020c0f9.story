 Don't be afraid to get bold with it! Go to the store and buy makeup items (such as mascara, foundation, lip liner, eyeliner, blush, etc.) that you are willing to wear. Each day, wear your makeup differently. For example, one day go for a natural look with lip gloss, and the next day some sparkly eyeshadow. Whatever you decide to do, keep it looking gorgeous.

Use makeup if you're allowed to wear some.
