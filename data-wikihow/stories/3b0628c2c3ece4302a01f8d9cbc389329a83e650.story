 If they can't go, they must skip a turn until they can. This encourages each player to tack on a letter or two to other already-formed words, making for a more exciting board.

To keep track of how often a player runs out, consider having them take fewer or more tiles each time. The second time they draw, they could take 8, the third time, 9. This way better, faster players are given a larger load to bare, helping out those who are just getting the hang of it.

When a player has no tiles left in their personal pile, give them 7 more tiles.
