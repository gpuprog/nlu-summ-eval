 The title goes directly underneath your information. The title should be centered in the middle of the page instead of aligned with the left margin.You should also use title-case capitalization for your title, where you capitalize the first and last word, as well as all other important words.
The title should be descriptive of your paper. Try to give the reader an idea of what your paper is about, though it can be a pun or funny, as well, such as "What's at Stake: Symbolism in Dracula"
If you have a sub-title, it should be set off with a semicolon, as in the example.
