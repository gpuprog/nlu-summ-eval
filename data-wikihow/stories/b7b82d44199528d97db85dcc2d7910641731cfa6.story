 Another option for your monthly drain-flush is to use white vinegar. Pour 1 cup of white vinegar down the drain, and wait 30 minutes. Follow with hot water from your faucet, letting the water run for 2-3 minutes. White vinegar contains acetic acid, which is excellent at dissolving built up grime in your pipes.
