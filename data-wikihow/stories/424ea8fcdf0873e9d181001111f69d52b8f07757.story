 Decide ahead of time how much you’re comfortable spending on gifts, and stick to that number. Budgeting will help protect your finances if you’re prone to overspending during manic episodes. If you’re worried about sticking to your budget, ask a friend to come shopping with you to keep you on track. Another tactic is to bring only the amount of cash in your budget, and leave other payment methods at home.
