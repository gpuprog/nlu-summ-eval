 Even if the jellyfish is dead, its poisonous cells can still cause a sting. Some varieties have very long tentacles (such as the Portuguese Man-of-War, that has tentacles up to fifty feet long), so it is best to stay far away from jellyfish.There are many different kinds and forms of jellyfish, and when they are washed ashore they may look like plastic bags or other debris. If you are not sure whether or not something is a jellyfish, it is best not to touch it at all.
Tell a lifeguard or other beach authority when you spot a jellyfish on the shore, so that it can be safely removed by someone trained to handle the creature.
