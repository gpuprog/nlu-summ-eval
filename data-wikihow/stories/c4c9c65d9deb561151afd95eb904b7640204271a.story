 Keep adding another stitch to the right needle and pulling the older stitch over it and off the needle. Work until the last stitch of your project is alone on your right needle. Be extra careful when doing these stitches, as they will make up the edge of your project. The quality of the stitching will be much more apparent than with the inner rows.
