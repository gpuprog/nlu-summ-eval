 One of the simplest ways to hedge your currency holdings is to buy some foreign currencies. If you live in a country that uses the Euro, for example, you can buy U.S. dollars, Swiss francs or Japanese yen (among others). If the value of the Euro drops relative to the other currencies, youâ€™ve sheltered yourself to the extent that you own the other currencies.
