 If your children are used to your helicopter parenting, they may be accustomed to running to you for help whenever something is challenging or doesn't go their way. This will not help your children learn and grow, so avoid running to their aid right away.If your children are in immediate danger of any kind, help them right away!
It may help to count to ten in non-emergency situations. For example, if your child asks you to help him with a puzzle, tell him you'll be there in a minute. Then count to ten, while he takes some more time to work on it himself. He might just figure it out without your help.
