 As you find your cardiovascular system getting stronger, keep track of your progress. This is extremely motivating, and you’ll be amazed at how much can change in a short time. Make charts on your computer or in a notebook, or write in a casual “diary” format.It helps to keep track of details: exactly what exercise you did and for how long (e.g. “ran 1.5 miles in 30 minutes”), what foods you ate (include nutritional information from the label) and in what portions, and other health-goals you have. Maybe you’re trying to quit smoking — record how many cigarettes you had that day. Weigh yourself weekly and write down your weight. Note if your clothing size decreases.
