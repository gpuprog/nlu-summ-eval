 As stated, your friend is probably already overwhelmed with his or her move. You do not want to dump your sadness on your friend. Seek out support from other friends and family members. Talk to them about how you're feeling about saying goodbye to your friend.Ask someone if you can talk to them first, explaining you need to sort out your feelings about your friend's coming move. Ask them if they can simply listen to you talk for a bit, and then let them know how you're feeling.
Choose someone who's empathetic, like a kind older relative or close mutual friend. Select someone who's listened to you in the past when you've been going through difficult times.
