 It can be difficult to manage two or more jobs, which may cause some people to try to do work for one job while they are on the clock for another job. However, this is a bad idea. Not only may doing work for one job while you are on the clock for another job get you into trouble, it will reduce your effectiveness.Stay focused on one job at a time to do the best work that you can at all of your jobs.
