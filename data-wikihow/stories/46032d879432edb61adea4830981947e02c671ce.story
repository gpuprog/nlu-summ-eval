 Wash your mason jar with soap and warm water and let it dry. If there are any labels, try peeling them off. You can remove the label residue by covering it with some cooking oil and scrubbing it with a scouring pad. Be sure to clean the oil off with some soap and water, and to wipe the area down with some rubbing alcohol.
