 Ideally, you will want to have other horses in nearby stables. Since horses enjoy each others company, keeping other horses nearby will allow your horse to feel comfortable during its time in the stable. Whenever possible, always try to meet your horse's social needs while he is in the stable.Try to keep your horse near horses that they are familiar with.
Don't separate your horse from other horses that they are usually around.
Horses seem to be happy in groups between four to ten other horses.
