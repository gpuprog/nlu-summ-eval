 The appetizers should already be on the tables as soon as guests arrive. At this time, the guests enjoy the appetizers as they mingle and catch up on lost time and while they await the bride and groom. The type of appetizers included is determined by how fancy the wedding is. They range from carrot sticks, celery, and cheese to shrimp cocktails and caviar. If you want to impress your guests then have a wide variety of appetizers.
