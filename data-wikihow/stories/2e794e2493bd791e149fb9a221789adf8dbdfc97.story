 The infinitive expresses the action that the subject of the sentence is going to do at some point in the near future. The entire phrase is a lot like English, when you say you are going to do something.For example, if you wanted to say "I am going to study a lot" in Spanish, you would say Yo voy a estudiar mucho (yo boy ah ess-too-DEE-ahr MOO-choh).
You also can add a word or phrase to indicate when the action is going to take place. For example, Yo voy a estudiar mucho mañana (yo boy ah ess-too-DEE-ahr MOO-choh mahn-YAHN-ah) – I am going to study a lot tomorrow.
