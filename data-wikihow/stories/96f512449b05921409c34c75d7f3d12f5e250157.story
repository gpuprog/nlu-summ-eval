 One of the best things about having a dog is the bond your create. Sometimes, this bond is so strong that your little furry friend might not know how to be independent. About 10% of all puppies and older dogs experience some level of separation anxiety. In the more extreme cases, a dog will throw a tantrum and start barking, pacing, defecating in inappropriate places, and destroying walls or doors in an attempt to get back to an owner.
