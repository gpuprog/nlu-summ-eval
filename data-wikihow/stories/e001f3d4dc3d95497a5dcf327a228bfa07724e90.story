 If you are using a pan, make sure it is a heavy duty, non-stick pan that is large enough to accommodate all of your steaks. Add med-high heat oil (like canola) to the pan and heat the oil on medium-high heat. Don’t use butter. It will brown and then burn. Don’t add the steaks until the oil is very hot.
