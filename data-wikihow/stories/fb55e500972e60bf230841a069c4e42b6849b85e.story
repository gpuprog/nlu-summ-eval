 For example in the video game The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess the villain Ganondorf is killed at the end as he tricked a Twili (the villain Zant) into believing he was a God and getting him to do the bad stuff for him (turning light world in to twilight) getting an orc (King Bulblin) to kidnap children and he killed Midna (Link's companion)

Make sure that if your villain does die they do at least 3 evil things to deserve that fate or 1 evil thing that is so downtrodden that it has to be so.
