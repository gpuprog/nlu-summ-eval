 You will have to change both your toddler and infant regularly. While changing your infant, it's important to be able to keep your eyes on your toddler. Keep the changing table in a space where you can observe your toddler while changing your infant.For example, keep a changing table in the living room, facing towards the room. If you need to change your toddler, you can keep an eye on your newborn from there.
