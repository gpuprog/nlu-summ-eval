 When you're trying to lose weight, even with a meat-based diet, it's crucial to have a nutritionally balanced meal plan. Writing down a few sample days can help you plan accordingly and help you to include a variety of foods and lean meats.


Take a few hours of your free time to write up your meal plan. Include lean meat and protein in most or all of your meals.
Also make sure to include a variety of fruits, vegetables, dairy and 100% whole grains (if you're including these in your diet). Consuming a variety of foods from each food group is essential for a balanced diet.
Consider your lifestyle as well. If you're busy, on-the-go or have little time to cook, consider purchasing protein or meat that is pre-cooked or frozen for easier meals.
