 Most states have a particular form you must fill out to request either a certified or informational copy of the death certificate.


If you're requesting a certified copy, you usually must be related to the person as defined by state law. In most states, certified copies are available for parents, children, and siblings of the deceased.Some jurisdictions require death records request forms to be signed in front of a notary. Staff at the vital records office will tell you if this is required, or you may simply look on the form to see if there is a place for the form to be notarized.If your request form must be notarized, you can fill out the required information, but don't sign it until you are in the presence of a notary.
You also may be required to submit documentation of your relationship to the deceased or your stated interest in the estate.
