 How many projects are you committed to? How many extracurricular stuff do you do? You can’t do it all. You need to learn to say no, and to value your time. And if you’ve already said yes, it’s still possible to say no. Just be honest with people and tell them that you have a high number of urgent projects to complete and cannot commit to this any longer. Slowly, you can eliminate your commitments to a very small number — only have those commitments in your life that really give you joy and value.
