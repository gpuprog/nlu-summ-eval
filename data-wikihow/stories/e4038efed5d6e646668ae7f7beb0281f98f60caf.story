 People with hypochondriasis and body dysmorphic disorder may both overreact to certain symptoms, but their concerns are very different. In the case of an outwardly visible symptom, such as a blemish, a patient with hypochondriasis would be concerned about an underlying medical condition that could be causing it, while a patient with body dysmorphic disorder would be more concerned about the physical appearance of the blemish.People with body dysmorphic disorder typically do not become preoccupied with symptoms that do not affect their physical appearance.
