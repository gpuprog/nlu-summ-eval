 The end of life, like the rest of life, often doesn’t go according to plan. Ask about how the hospice provider will adapt and adjust to changing circumstances during the period of care. For instance:


If the patient can no longer remain at home despite that being the original plan, what alternatives are available? Does the provider have a dedicated care center, or space in a hospital?Is the hospice service willing and able to offer or support treatments like blood transfusions, supplemental oxygen, feeding tubes, emergency hospital visits, and even chemotherapy or radiation strictly for pain management and patient comfort? Alternatively, do they understand and support the patient’s advance directives regarding limits of care?On a more practical level, is the hospice provider ready to deal with power outages, severe weather, and other emergency situations? Ask to see their emergency plan.
