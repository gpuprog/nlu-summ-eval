 Get in touch with your local comic book store owners. Talk to them about allowing you to give away free copies of your manga. You may even convince them to let you sell your manga in their store.


Put up fliers in the comic book store that advertises your manga. Make sure it has your name, contact information, and the address for your website so people can go check out your work.
Leave business cards by the register.
