 Set a definite time to make your grand exit. Avoid having an indefinite end to the reception. Wedding receptions often feature lots of alcohol, and whether it’s open bar or not, a party that goes into the wee hours can be costly, put your guests at risk, and threaten your big day with drama.While you should set a time to make your exit, be prepared to make it earlier in the evening. For example, if your reception is on a Sunday night, your guests might start to leave before your scheduled exit. You’ll want to make your exit while you still have enough guests to give you a proper send-off.
